These can indicate a critical valve problem or complication.",
    "general_advice": "Aortic valve disease occurs when the aortic valve, located between the left ventricle (the heart's main pumping chamber) and the aorta (the body's main artery), doesn't work properly. The two main types are: 1) Aortic stenosis: The valve cusps become stiff and narrowed, making it harder for the heart to pump blood out to the body. 2) Aortic regurgitation (or insufficiency): The valve doesn't close tightly, allowing some blood to leak backward into the left ventricle. Causes can include congenital defects, age-related calcification, rheumatic fever, infections (endocarditis), or connective tissue disorders. Symptoms may not appear until the condition is advanced and can include chest pain (angina), fatigue, shortness of breath (especially with exertion or when lying down), dizziness or fainting, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), and swollen ankles/feet.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience any symptoms suggestive of aortic valve disease, see a doctor (often a cardiologist). If a heart murmur is detected during a routine exam, further investigation (like an echocardiogram) is usually needed. Early diagnosis and monitoring are important.

This could indicate a complication like retinal detachment or severe inflammation.",
    "general_advice": "Aphakia is the absence of the lens of the eye. The lens is the clear structure behind the iris that focuses light onto the retina. Aphakia most commonly occurs after surgical removal of a cataract (a clouded lens) when an intraocular lens (IOL) implant is not placed, or if an IOL is removed due to complications. It can also result from eye trauma or, rarely, be a congenital condition. Without a lens, the eye is extremely farsighted (hyperopic) and has very poor, blurry vision. There is also a loss of accommodation (the ability to focus on near objects).",

Chronic urinary retention can lead to serious kidney damage.",
    "general_advice": "Atonic bladder (also known as flaccid or neurogenic bladder) is a condition where the bladder muscle (detrusor muscle) loses its ability to contract effectively, leading to an inability to empty the bladder completely or at all (urinary retention). This results in the bladder becoming overstretched and distended. It's usually caused by damage to the nerves that control bladder function. Common causes include spinal cord injuries, nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, pelvic surgery, or certain medications. Symptoms include difficulty starting urination, a weak or interrupted urine stream, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, frequent urination of small amounts, overflow incontinence (leaking urine when the bladder is too full), and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).",

Some AFib episodes can be life-threatening or lead to serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib or AF) is the most common type of sustained cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). It occurs when the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly, out of coordination with the lower chambers (the ventricles). This can lead to a rapid and irregular pulse. AFib can cause palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest discomfort, though some people have no symptoms. Major risks associated with AFib are stroke (due to blood clots forming in the atria) and heart failure. Risk factors include older age, high blood pressure, underlying heart disease (coronary artery disease, valve disease, heart failure), obesity, diabetes, thyroid disease, excessive alcohol intake, and sleep apnea.",

Like AFib, atrial flutter can lead to serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Atrial flutter is another type of abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that originates in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). Unlike the chaotic rhythm of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter is characterized by a rapid but regular (or sometimes regularly irregular) atrial rhythm, often around 250-350 beats per minute. Not all of these fast atrial beats conduct to the ventricles (lower chambers), so the ventricular rate (pulse) is usually slower but can still be quite fast and regular (e.g., 150 bpm if there's 2:1 conduction). Symptoms can include palpitations (often described as a rapid, regular fluttering), fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest discomfort. Atrial flutter shares many risk factors with AFib (e.g., heart disease, lung disease, previous heart surgery) and also carries an increased risk of stroke.",

Most simple cysts are discovered incidentally during imaging tests (like ultrasound, CT, or MRI) done for other reasons. They are different from cysts associated with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which is a more serious genetic disorder.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most simple kidney cysts do not require treatment. If a cyst is found, your doctor will evaluate its characteristics (e.g., size, appearance on imaging) to confirm it's a simple cyst and not something more complex or suspicious. Follow-up imaging may be recommended periodically to monitor for any changes, especially for larger cysts. If a cyst causes symptoms (e.g., pain, blockage of urine flow, high blood pressure - though this is uncommon for simple cysts), treatment (like drainage or surgical removal) might be considered.",

    "general_advice": "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo, which is a sudden sensation that you or your surroundings are spinning or whirling. BPPV occurs when tiny calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia or 'canaliths'), normally located in a part of the inner ear called the utricle, become dislodged and migrate into one of the semicircular canals (fluid-filled tubes in the inner ear that sense head rotation). This makes the canal sensitive to head position changes it would normally not respond to. Episodes of vertigo are brief (usually less than a minute), intense, and are triggered by specific changes in head position, such as rolling over in bed, looking up, or bending over.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience recurrent episodes of vertigo, especially triggered by head movements, see a doctor (primary care, neurologist, or ENT specialist). They can diagnose BPPV (often with specific positional tests like the Dix-Hallpike maneuver) and differentiate it from other causes of dizziness. Treatment often involves canalith repositioning procedures (like the Epley maneuver or Semont maneuver) performed by a trained professional, which can be very effective.",

    "general_advice": "Brachial neuritis, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome or neuralgic amyotrophy, is a rare disorder characterized by the sudden onset of severe pain, usually in the shoulder and upper arm, followed by muscle weakness, paralysis, and atrophy (wasting) in the affected arm, shoulder, and sometimes hand. It affects the brachial plexus, a network of nerves that extends from the spinal cord in the neck through the shoulder and into the arm. The exact cause is unknown, but it's thought to be an immune-mediated inflammatory response, often triggered by a recent infection, vaccination, surgery, or injury, though it can also occur spontaneously. Sensory changes (numbness, tingling) can also occur. Recovery can be slow, often taking months to years, and may not always be complete.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop sudden, severe shoulder/arm pain followed by weakness, consult a doctor (neurologist).

They can feel like soft grapes or water-filled balloons, or sometimes they can be firm. Cysts can vary in size and may become tender or painful, especially before a menstrual period due to hormonal changes. Simple cysts are fluid-filled with smooth, thin walls and do not increase breast cancer risk. Complex or complicated cysts have some internal debris or thicker walls and may require further evaluation to rule out other conditions.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you discover any new breast lump or change, including what you suspect might be a cyst, always see a doctor for evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out cancer. Diagnosis is often made with ultrasound, which can distinguish a fluid-filled cyst from a solid mass. A mammogram may also be done. If a cyst is large, painful, or if there's any uncertainty, a fine-needle aspiration (draining the fluid with a needle) may be performed, which can both diagnose and treat the cyst (by relieving pressure).",

    "general_advice": "Cardiomyopathy is a general term for diseases of the heart muscle (myocardium) that make it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively to the rest of the body. It can lead to heart failure. There are several types of cardiomyopathy, including: 1) Dilated cardiomyopathy: The heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle) becomes enlarged (dilated) and weakened. 2) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. 3) Restrictive cardiomyopathy: The heart muscle becomes stiff and less elastic, impairing its ability to fill with blood. 4) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD): Muscle tissue in the right ventricle is replaced by scar tissue and fat, leading to arrhythmias. Causes can be genetic/inherited, or acquired due to conditions like long-term high blood pressure, heart attacks, viral infections, alcohol abuse, certain drugs, or unknown (idiopathic). Symptoms can include shortness of breath (with exertion or at rest), fatigue, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet (edema), irregular heartbeat or palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.",

    "general_advice": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition that causes pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and arm. It occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the palm of the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed (compressed) at the wrist within a narrow passageway called the carpal tunnel. The median nerve controls sensation to the palm side of the thumb and fingers (except the little finger), as well as some small muscles in the hand. Repetitive hand and wrist motions, prolonged wrist flexion or extension, wrist injuries, and certain medical conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, thyroid disorders, pregnancy, obesity) can contribute to swelling and pressure within the carpal tunnel. Symptoms often start gradually and may be worse at night or when performing certain activities.",

    "general_advice": "A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. The lens is located behind the iris and pupil and works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina at the back of the eye to produce clear vision. When a cataract forms, it's like looking through a foggy or dusty window. Most cataracts develop slowly as part of the aging process (age-related cataracts are very common). Other causes include eye injuries, certain medications (like long-term steroid use), diabetes, excessive sun exposure, smoking, and genetic factors. Symptoms include blurry, cloudy, or dim vision; increased difficulty with vision at night; sensitivity to light and glare; seeing 'halos' around lights; frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription; fading or yellowing of colors; and double vision in a single eye.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice changes in your vision or suspect you have cataracts, schedule an eye examination with an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

    "general_advice": "Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When a person with celiac disease consumes gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the lining of the small intestine (specifically the villi, which are tiny finger-like projections responsible for nutrient absorption). This damage interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food, leading to malnutrition and a range of symptoms. Symptoms can vary widely and affect multiple systems. Digestive symptoms may include diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, nausea, and vomiting. Non-digestive symptoms can include fatigue, anemia (iron deficiency), bone or joint pain, osteoporosis, skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), mouth ulcers, headaches, depression, anxiety, and neurological issues (numbness/tingling, balance problems). Some people may have no obvious symptoms.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you or your child has celiac disease based on symptoms or risk factors (e.g., family history, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease), consult a doctor (primary care or gastroenterologist). Diagnosis involves blood tests (to check for specific antibodies like tTG-IgA) and usually an endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine to confirm damage to the villi. It's important to continue eating gluten until testing is complete, as a gluten-free diet can affect test results.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. This means avoiding all foods and products containing wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. Oats may be tolerated if certified gluten-free (to avoid cross-contamination).",

    "general_advice": "Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix, the lower, narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina. It can be caused by various factors, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, or genital herpes. Non-infectious causes can include allergic reactions (e.g., to spermicides, latex in condoms, or feminine hygiene products), irritation from foreign objects (like diaphragms or cervical caps), or bacterial vaginosis. Often, cervicitis causes no symptoms, but when symptoms occur, they may include: abnormal vaginal discharge (may be grayish, yellowish, or have an odor), bleeding between periods or after intercourse, pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), vaginal itching or irritation, and frequent or painful urination.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience any symptoms of cervicitis, or if you've been exposed to an STI, see a doctor or gynecologist. Diagnosis involves a pelvic exam, and samples of cervical discharge may be taken to test for infections. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If an STI is identified, antibiotics or antiviral medications will be prescribed. Your sexual partner(s) will also need to be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread.",

    "general_advice": "A chalazion is a small, usually painless, firm lump or swelling that appears in the upper or lower eyelid. It's caused by a blockage and inflammation of a Meibomian gland, which are small oil glands located along the edge of the eyelids that produce the oily part of tears. When a gland becomes blocked, the oil builds up and causes the gland to swell, forming a chalazion. It can sometimes become red, swollen, and tender if it gets inflamed or infected (internal hordeolum or stye), but often it's a non-tender, slowly enlarging lump. It's different from an external stye (hordeolum), which is an infection of an eyelash follicle and is usually more painful and closer to the eyelid margin.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a chalazion is persistent, very large, affects vision, or if you are unsure of the diagnosis, consult an eye doctor. They can confirm it's a chalazion and may recommend treatment if it's bothersome or not resolving. In rare cases, a persistent chalazion might need to be biopsied to rule out other conditions.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Apply warm compresses to the affected eyelid for 10-15 minutes, 2-4 times a day. The warmth can help soften the hardened oil blocking the gland and promote drainage. Gently massage the eyelid afterwards (with clean hands) towards the lashes to help express the contents.",
      "Keep the eyelids clean. You can use a mild eyelid cleanser or diluted baby shampoo on a cotton swab to gently clean the base of the eyelashes.",
      "Avoid squeezing or trying to pop the chalazion, as this can worsen inflammation or spread infection.",
      "Do not wear eye makeup or contact lenses while you have an active chalazion or if it's inflamed.",
      "If a chalazion doesn't resolve with home care, an eye doctor may recommend a corticosteroid injection into the chalazion to reduce inflammation, or a minor surgical procedure (incision and curettage) to drain it."

Complications are more common in these groups.",
    "general_advice": "Chickenpox (varicella) is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It's characterized by an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) that appear all over the body. The rash typically starts as small red spots, which then develop into blisters that eventually crust over and heal. New spots can continue to appear for several days, so all three stages (spots, blisters, scabs) may be present at the same time. Other symptoms usually precede the rash by 1-2 days and include fever, headache, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Chickenpox is usually mild in healthy children but can be more severe in adolescents, adults, pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals. After a person has had chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate later in life to cause shingles (herpes zoster).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Consult a doctor if you suspect chickenpox, especially to confirm the diagnosis and discuss management, particularly for individuals at high risk of complications (see emergency advice).

    "general_advice": "Chlamydia is a very common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium *Chlamydia trachomatis*. It can infect both men and women and often has no symptoms, so many people are unaware they have it. If symptoms do occur, they may appear several weeks after infection. In women, symptoms can include abnormal vaginal discharge (may be yellowish or have an odor), burning sensation during urination, pain during intercourse, bleeding between periods or after sex, and lower abdominal pain. In men, symptoms can include discharge from the penis (may be watery or milky), burning sensation during urination, and pain or swelling in one or both testicles. Chlamydia can also infect the rectum (causing rectal pain, discharge, bleeding) or throat (usually asymptomatic). Untreated chlamydia can lead to serious long-term complications, including PID, infertility, ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis or reactive arthritis in men.",

Complications like gallbladder rupture or gangrene can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, a small organ located beneath the liver that stores and releases bile (a digestive fluid). It most commonly occurs when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile flows out of the gallbladder (this is called acute calculous cholecystitis). This blockage causes bile to build up, leading to inflammation, pressure, and pain. Less commonly, cholecystitis can occur without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis), often in critically ill patients. Symptoms typically include steady, severe pain in the upper right or central abdomen that may last for hours, pain that worsens with deep breaths, tenderness over the abdomen when touched, nausea, vomiting, and fever.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of cholecystitis, go to an emergency department or see your doctor immediately. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, blood tests (to check for signs of inflammation or infection, and liver function), and imaging tests (ultrasound is usually the first choice; HIDA scan, CT scan, or MRI may also be used).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "There are no direct self-care treatments for an acute cholecystitis attack; it requires medical management.",

      "Surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the definitive treatment and is often performed within a few days of admission, or sometimes later if the inflammation needs to settle first. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (minimally invasive) is the most common approach.",
      "To potentially reduce the risk of gallstones (a major cause of cholecystitis): maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet rich in fiber and healthy fats (avoiding very high-fat or greasy foods if they trigger symptoms), and exercise regularly.

These are serious conditions.",
    "general_advice": "Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of one or more gallstones in the common bile duct (CBD). The CBD is the tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine. Gallstones usually form in the gallbladder and can then pass into the CBD, or less commonly, they can form within the bile ducts themselves. When a stone obstructs the CBD, it can prevent bile from flowing properly, leading to symptoms and complications. Symptoms can include severe, episodic pain in the upper right or central abdomen (biliary colic, often lasting longer than with gallbladder stones alone), jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever or chills if infection (cholangitis) develops. It can also lead to pancreatitis if the stone blocks the opening where the bile duct and pancreatic duct join.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of choledocholithiasis, especially jaundice or severe pain, see a doctor or go to an emergency department promptly.

    "general_advice": "A cholesteatoma is an abnormal, non-cancerous skin growth (a cyst or sac filled with old skin cells) that can develop in the middle ear, behind the eardrum. It often starts due to recurrent ear infections or poor Eustachian tube function (the tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat). When the Eustachian tube doesn't work well, it can create negative pressure in the middle ear, pulling part of the eardrum inward and forming a pocket where skin cells can accumulate. Cholesteatomas can grow over time and damage the delicate bones of the middle ear (ossicles), leading to hearing loss. They can also cause chronic ear discharge (often foul-smelling), ear pain or pressure, dizziness, and rarely, more serious complications if they erode into the inner ear, facial nerve, or brain.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent ear discharge, hearing loss, ear pain, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in the ear, consult an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist. Diagnosis involves an ear exam (otoscopy), hearing tests (audiometry), and often a CT scan of the temporal bones to assess the extent of the cholesteatoma. Surgical removal is usually necessary.",

While CIDP is chronic, acute deteriorations can occur.",
    "general_advice": "Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive or relapsing-remitting weakness and impaired sensory function in the arms and legs. It's caused by damage to the myelin sheath (the protective covering of nerve fibers) of the peripheral nerves. This damage is thought to be due to an autoimmune response where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin. Symptoms typically develop gradually over two months or more (distinguishing it from Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which has a more acute onset) and can include: progressive muscle weakness (often symmetrical, affecting both proximal and distal muscles), numbness, tingling, or burning sensations (paresthesias), loss of reflexes, fatigue, and difficulty with balance and walking. It can affect people of any age but is more common in adults.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop progressive weakness, numbness, or tingling in your limbs, consult a doctor (neurologist). Diagnosis involves a neurological examination, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) – which typically show demyelination, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for elevated protein in cerebrospinal fluid, and sometimes nerve biopsy. Early diagnosis and treatment can help limit nerve damage and improve outcomes.",

    "general_advice": "Cold sores, also known as fever blisters or oral herpes, are small, painful, fluid-filled blisters that typically form on or around the lips, mouth, or nose. They are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and less commonly by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). After the initial infection, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate periodically, causing recurrent outbreaks. Outbreaks are often triggered by factors like stress, fatigue, illness (fever, cold), sun exposure, hormonal changes, or minor skin trauma to the area. Before the blisters appear, there may be a prodrome of tingling, itching, or burning at the site. The blisters then form, rupture, ooze, and eventually crust over and heal, usually within 7-14 days. Cold sores are contagious, especially when blisters are present, and can be spread through direct contact (kissing, sharing utensils or towels) or contact with the fluid from the blisters.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most cold sores don't require medical treatment. However, see a doctor if outbreaks are frequent or severe, or if you have concerns. A doctor can confirm the diagnosis and may prescribe antiviral medications (oral or topical, e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) to shorten the duration of an outbreak or, in some cases, for suppressive therapy to reduce recurrence frequency if started early in an outbreak or taken daily.",
    "self_care_tips": [

    "general_advice": "A colonic polyp (or colon polyp) is a small growth of tissue that forms on the lining of the colon (large intestine) or rectum. Polyps are common, especially as people age. Most polyps are benign (non-cancerous), but some types (particularly adenomatous polyps or adenomas) have the potential to develop into colorectal cancer over time if not removed. Other types include hyperplastic polyps (usually benign) and serrated polyps (can have increased cancer risk). Polyps often cause no symptoms and are usually found during colorectal cancer screening procedures like colonoscopy. When symptoms do occur, they may include rectal bleeding (bright red or dark blood in stool), changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea lasting more than a week), abdominal pain or cramping, or iron-deficiency anemia (from chronic blood loss). Risk factors for polyps include age over 50, family history of polyps or colorectal cancer, personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis), obesity, smoking, high-fat/low-fiber diet, and lack of exercise.",

    "general_advice": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by severe, persistent, burning pain, usually in an arm or leg, that is disproportionate to any initial injury (if an injury occurred). It often develops after an injury, surgery, stroke, or heart attack, but can also occur without a clear trigger. CRPS is thought to involve dysfunction in the central and/or peripheral nervous systems. Symptoms can include: intense burning or throbbing pain, swelling, changes in skin temperature (affected limb may feel warmer or cooler than the opposite limb), changes in skin color (blotchy, purple, pale, or red), changes in skin texture (shiny, thin, sweaty), changes in hair and nail growth, joint stiffness, muscle spasms or weakness, and limited range of motion in the affected limb. There are two types: CRPS-I (formerly Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy - RSD) occurs without confirmed nerve injury, and CRPS-II (formerly causalgia) occurs with confirmed nerve injury.",

These could indicate a more severe brain injury like a hematoma (bleed in the brain).",
    "general_advice": "A concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or by a hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, stretching and damaging brain cells and creating chemical changes in the brain. Concussions are common in contact sports but can also result from falls, car accidents, or any impact to the head. Symptoms can vary widely and may not appear immediately. They can include: headache or pressure in the head, dizziness or balance problems, nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to light or noise, blurred vision, feeling foggy or groggy, difficulty concentrating or remembering, confusion, drowsiness or fatigue, and emotional changes (irritability, sadness, anxiety). Loss of consciousness is not required for a concussion diagnosis.",

While conversion disorder is not life-threatening in itself, the symptoms can be disabling and it's crucial to exclude other serious medical causes.",
    "general_advice": "Conversion disorder, now officially termed Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD) in the DSM-5, is a mental health condition in which a person experiences physical and sensory problems, such as paralysis, numbness, blindness, deafness, or seizures, with no underlying neurological or medical cause that can explain them. The symptoms are real and not intentionally produced or feigned (as in factitious disorder or malingering). It's thought that the symptoms arise as a physical manifestation (conversion) of psychological distress, conflict, or trauma, though the person is often unaware of this connection. Symptoms can appear suddenly, often after a stressful event. The specific symptoms can vary widely and may affect motor function (e.g., weakness, paralysis, abnormal movements, tremors, difficulty walking, swallowing problems, speech impairment) or sensory function (e.g., numbness, blindness, deafness, loss of smell or touch).",

Respiratory distress can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a common respiratory infection in young children (typically ages 6 months to 3 years) that causes inflammation and swelling of the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe), leading to a narrowed airway. It's usually caused by a virus (most often parainfluenza virus). The hallmark symptoms are a distinctive barking cough (like a seal), hoarse voice, and stridor (a harsh, high-pitched sound when inhaling). Symptoms are often worse at night and may be preceded by cold-like symptoms (runny nose, fever) for a few days. Most cases are mild and can be managed at home.",

Do not attempt to move the person if there's a risk of further injury (e.g., spinal injury, unstable debris) unless they are in immediate danger. If a limb is crushed for a prolonged period, be aware of crush syndrome, which can occur after the limb is released and toxins are released into the bloodstream, potentially causing kidney failure and other life-threatening complications. Provide first aid for bleeding if safe to do so.",
    "general_advice": "A crushing injury occurs when a part of the body is subjected to high-pressure compressive forces, often between two heavy objects or when trapped under a heavy object. This can cause extensive damage to skin, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and bones. The severity depends on the amount of force, the duration of compression, and the body part involved. Complications can include severe bleeding, fractures, compartment syndrome (dangerous pressure buildup within muscle compartments), nerve damage, infection, rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue releasing harmful substances into the blood), and crush syndrome (systemic effects after prolonged compression, especially of large muscle masses).",

These fungi are found in the environment worldwide, often in soil contaminated with bird droppings (especially pigeon droppings for *C. neoformans*) or associated with certain trees (e.g., eucalyptus trees for *C. gattii*). Infection usually occurs by inhaling the fungal spores. In healthy individuals, cryptococcal infection is often asymptomatic or causes a mild, self-limiting lung infection. However, in people with weakened immune systems (e.g., those with HIV/AIDS - especially with low CD4 counts, organ transplant recipients, patients on long-term corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs), *Cryptococcus* can cause severe and life-threatening disease, most commonly cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord membranes) or disseminated cryptococcosis (infection spreading throughout the body). *C. gattii* can also cause serious illness in apparently healthy individuals.",

    "general_advice": "Cryptorchidism, or undescended testicle(s), is a condition present at birth in which one or both testes have not moved down into their proper position in the scrotum. Testes develop in the abdomen during fetal development and normally descend into the scrotum shortly before birth or within the first few months after birth. An undescended testicle may be located anywhere along the path of descent (e.g., in the abdomen, inguinal canal/groin) or sometimes in an abnormal (ectopic) location. It's more common in premature infants. While many undescended testes will descend on their own within the first 3-6 months of life, those that remain undescended require treatment. Untreated cryptorchidism can lead to reduced fertility, an increased risk of testicular cancer later in life, testicular torsion, and inguinal hernias.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Cryptorchidism is usually detected by a doctor during routine newborn or infant check-ups. If a testicle has not descended by 4-6 months of age, referral to a pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon is typically recommended to discuss treatment options, usually surgical.",

    "general_advice": "Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. This can occur due to: 1) Exogenous Cushing's syndrome: Taking corticosteroid medications (like prednisone) in high doses over a long period (most common cause). 2) Endogenous Cushing's syndrome: The body produces too much cortisol. This can be due to a pituitary gland tumor secreting excess ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol (this is called Cushing's disease); an adrenal gland tumor producing excess cortisol; or, rarely, an ACTH-producing tumor elsewhere in the body (ectopic ACTH syndrome). Symptoms can include: weight gain, particularly in the face ('moon face'), between the shoulders ('buffalo hump'), and abdomen; thin arms and legs; easy bruising; purple or pink stretch marks (striae) on the skin; thinning, fragile skin; slow healing of cuts; acne; increased body and facial hair (hirsutism) in women; irregular menstrual periods; muscle weakness; fatigue; high blood pressure; high blood sugar (diabetes); mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression); and bone loss (osteoporosis).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, especially if you are on long-term corticosteroid therapy or have unexplained weight gain with other characteristic features, consult a doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis involves tests to measure cortisol levels (e.g., 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, dexamethasone suppression test) and further tests to determine the underlying cause (e.g., ACTH levels, imaging of pituitary/adrenal glands).",

People with CF are prone to serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system, but can also impact other organs like the pancreas, liver, intestines, and reproductive system. It's caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, which leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus and abnormally salty sweat. In the lungs, this thick mucus clogs airways, traps bacteria (leading to chronic infections, inflammation, and progressive lung damage), and makes breathing difficult. In the pancreas, it blocks the release of digestive enzymes, leading to poor absorption of nutrients (especially fats) and malnutrition. Symptoms can vary in severity and age of onset but may include: persistent cough with thick mucus, frequent lung infections (pneumonia, bronchitis), wheezing, shortness of breath, poor growth or weight gain despite good appetite (failure to thrive in infants), greasy, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea), salty-tasting skin, and male infertility.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "CF is often diagnosed in infancy through newborn screening programs. If not detected at birth, consult a doctor if a child or adult has persistent respiratory or digestive symptoms suggestive of CF, or a family history of the disease.

Neurocysticercosis can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Cysticercosis is a parasitic tissue infection caused by larval cysts (cysticerci) of the pork tapeworm, *Taenia solium*. Humans become infected by ingesting *T. solium* eggs, usually through food or water contaminated with fecal matter from a human tapeworm carrier, or by autoinfection in a person with an adult tapeworm. When the eggs hatch in the intestine, the larvae can travel through the bloodstream to various tissues and form cysts. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) occurs when these cysts form in the brain or spinal cord and is the most serious form of the disease, being a major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. Cysts can also form in muscles, eyes, or skin. Symptoms depend on the number, size, location, and stage (viable, degenerating, calcified) of the cysts. For NCC, common symptoms include seizures, headaches, hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the brain), neurological deficits, and cognitive impairment. Muscle cysts may cause lumps or mild pain. Eye cysts can cause vision problems.",

Risk factors for DVT include: prolonged immobility (e.g., long travel, bed rest after surgery or illness), major surgery (especially orthopedic surgery of hip/knee), trauma or injury to a vein, cancer and its treatments, inherited blood clotting disorders (thrombophilia), hormone therapy or hormonal contraceptives, pregnancy and postpartum period, obesity, smoking, older age, and varicose veins.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of a DVT (e.g., unexplained pain, swelling, tenderness, redness, or warmth in a limb, especially if one-sided), see a doctor immediately or go to an emergency department. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent PE. Diagnosis often involves ultrasound (Doppler ultrasound) of the affected limb and sometimes blood tests (like D-dimer).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "DVT requires medical treatment, usually with anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) like heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs - e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran). These prevent new clots from forming and existing clots from growing larger.",
      "Follow your doctor's instructions for anticoagulant therapy meticulously (duration, dosage, monitoring if needed - e.g., INR for warfarin).",
      "Compression stockings: May be recommended to improve blood flow and reduce swelling and pain.",
      "Elevation of the affected limb can help reduce swelling.",
      "Early ambulation (walking) is often encouraged once anticoagulation is started, as appropriate.",
      "In some severe cases, procedures like thrombolysis (clot-busting drugs delivered via catheter) or thrombectomy (surgical removal of the clot) may be considered.",
      "Prevention of DVT is important, especially if you have risk factors:",
      "  - During long travel: Get up and walk around frequently, do leg/foot exercises while seated, wear compression stockings, stay hydrated.",
      "  - After surgery or during illness: Follow instructions for early mobilization, use prescribed DVT prophylaxis (e.g., anticoagulants, compression devices).",

    "emergency_advice": "While DDD is usually a chronic condition, seek immediate medical attention if back or neck pain is accompanied by: sudden loss of bladder or bowel control, progressive weakness or numbness in legs or arms, saddle anesthesia (numbness in groin/buttocks), or if pain is severe and unrelenting after a new injury. These could indicate a serious neurological emergency like cauda equina syndrome or acute severe nerve compression.",
    "general_advice": "Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is not actually a 'disease' but rather a condition that describes the natural changes that occur in the spinal discs as people age. Intervertebral discs are soft, compressible shock absorbers between the vertebrae of the spine. With age, these discs can lose fluid (dehydrate), become thinner, less flexible, and more prone to tearing or bulging. These changes can lead to pain, stiffness, and sometimes nerve-related symptoms if the degenerated disc presses on nearby spinal nerves or the spinal cord. DDD can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (mid-back), or lumbar (low back) spine. Symptoms vary widely; some people have no pain, while others experience chronic pain that can range from mild to severe, and may be localized or radiate to other areas (e.g., sciatica if a lumbar disc affects the sciatic nerve). Pain is often worse with certain activities (like sitting, bending, lifting, twisting) and may improve with rest or changing positions.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent back or neck pain, or radiating pain, numbness, or weakness, consult a doctor (primary care, physiatrist, orthopedist, or neurosurgeon).

    "general_advice": "Dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay or cavities, is the destruction of tooth structure caused by acids produced by bacteria in dental plaque. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that constantly forms on teeth. When you consume sugary or starchy foods and drinks, the bacteria in plaque feed on these sugars and produce acids that attack the tooth enamel (the hard outer layer of the tooth). Over time, repeated acid attacks can cause the enamel to demineralize and break down, forming a cavity. If left untreated, decay can progress through the dentin (the layer beneath enamel) and reach the pulp (the innermost part of the tooth containing nerves and blood vessels), leading to pain, infection (abscess), and eventual tooth loss. Early decay may not cause symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms can include toothache (spontaneous or when biting), tooth sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet, visible holes or pits in teeth, and brown, black, or white staining on tooth surfaces.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Regular dental check-ups (usually every 6 months) are essential for early detection and treatment of dental caries, often before they cause symptoms. If you experience toothache, sensitivity, or notice signs of decay, see your dentist promptly.

It's different from diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), as DI is not related to blood sugar levels but rather to a problem with the body's ability to regulate fluid balance. There are different types: 1) Central DI: The most common type, caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin), which is produced in the hypothalamus and stored/released by the pituitary gland. ADH tells the kidneys to reabsorb water. Causes include damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland (e.g., from tumor, surgery, head injury, inflammation, or idiopathic). 2) Nephrogenic DI: The kidneys are unable to respond properly to ADH. Can be inherited or caused by certain medications (e.g., lithium), kidney disease, or electrolyte imbalances. 3) Gestational DI: Occurs during pregnancy when an enzyme made by the placenta breaks down the mother's ADH. 4) Dipsogenic DI (Primary Polydipsia): Caused by excessive fluid intake due to a defect in the thirst mechanism or psychological factors, leading to suppression of ADH.",

As a result, the body starts breaking down fat for fuel, which produces acidic waste products called ketones. When ketones build up in the blood, they make it acidic, leading to DKA. DKA is often triggered by an illness or infection, missed insulin doses or inadequate insulin therapy, or newly diagnosed, untreated type 1 diabetes. High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) are usually present, along with high ketone levels in the blood and/or urine.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if DKA is suspected. Diagnosis involves blood tests for glucose, ketones, electrolytes, blood gases (to check acidity), and kidney function, as well as urine tests for ketones and glucose.",

    "general_advice": "Diabetic kidney disease, also known as diabetic nephropathy, is a common and serious complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It's a progressive condition where high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels (glomeruli) in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. Over time, this damage impairs the kidneys' ability to filter properly, leading to a buildup of waste products and fluid in the body, and leakage of protein (especially albumin) into the urine. High blood pressure, also common in diabetes, further contributes to kidney damage. In its early stages, diabetic kidney disease often has no symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms may include: swelling in feet, ankles, legs, or around eyes (edema); foamy urine (due to protein); increased need to urinate, especially at night; fatigue; loss of appetite; nausea; itching; and difficulty concentrating. It can eventually lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or kidney transplant.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have diabetes, regular screening for diabetic kidney disease is crucial. This involves annual urine tests (to check for albumin - microalbuminuria is an early sign) and blood tests (to measure creatinine and estimate glomerular filtration rate - eGFR). Early detection and management can help slow the progression of kidney damage.

These could indicate a vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment, which are sight-threatening emergencies.",
    "general_advice": "Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). Chronically high blood sugar levels damage these blood vessels, causing them to leak fluid or blood, or to become blocked. There are two main stages: 1) Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR): Early stage, where blood vessels weaken and may leak, causing retinal swelling (macular edema, a common cause of vision loss) or form small outpouchings (microaneurysms). 2) Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR): Advanced stage, where damaged blood vessels close off, leading to the growth of new, abnormal, fragile blood vessels on the retina (neovascularization). These new vessels can bleed into the vitreous (vitreous hemorrhage), cause scar tissue formation (which can pull on the retina, leading to retinal detachment), or cause neovascular glaucoma. Diabetic retinopathy often has no symptoms in its early stages, but can eventually lead to blurred vision, floaters, dark spots, difficulty seeing colors, and progressive vision loss if untreated.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have diabetes, regular comprehensive dilated eye exams with an ophthalmologist or optometrist experienced in diabetic eye care are crucial for early detection and treatment (usually annually, or more often if retinopathy is present).

Keep the head, neck, and back aligned and as still as possible to prevent further injury to the spinal cord. Await professional emergency medical personnel for safe immobilization and transport.",
    "general_advice": "A vertebral dislocation occurs when one vertebra (bone of the spine) is displaced from its normal alignment with the vertebra above or below it. This usually results from high-energy trauma, such as a motor vehicle accident, a fall from height, or a severe sports injury. It often involves extensive ligamentous damage and is frequently associated with vertebral fractures. The displacement can compress or transect the spinal cord or nerve roots, leading to severe neurological deficits, including paralysis, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder/bowel control below the level of injury. Dislocations can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (mid-back), or lumbar (low back) spine. Cervical dislocations are particularly dangerous due to the proximity to the brainstem and nerves controlling breathing.",

These disorders often develop as a coping mechanism in response to trauma, particularly severe, chronic trauma experienced during childhood (e.g., physical, sexual, or emotional abuse). Dissociation is a way the mind distances itself from overwhelming experiences. Types of dissociative disorders include: 1) Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID, formerly Multiple Personality Disorder): Characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession. 2) Dissociative Amnesia: Inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. May involve dissociative fugue (sudden, unexpected travel away from home with inability to recall one's past). 3) Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder: Persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization (feeling detached from one's own mental processes or body, like an outside observer) and/or derealization (experiencing the external world as unreal, dreamlike, or distorted).",

ADRs can range from mild (e.g., drowsiness, nausea, rash) to severe and life-threatening. A drug allergy is a specific type of ADR where the immune system overreacts to a medication, treating it as a harmful foreign substance (allergen). Allergic reactions can vary from mild skin rashes or hives to severe anaphylaxis. Other ADRs are not immune-mediated and can be due to side effects (predictable, dose-related effects), drug interactions, or individual intolerance. Almost any drug can cause an ADR. Common symptoms of milder reactions include skin rash, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache.",

For opioids: while usually not directly life-threatening, severe dehydration from vomiting/diarrhea, or suicidal ideation due to extreme discomfort can be emergencies. Medically supervised detoxification is often necessary and always recommended for alcohol and sedative-hypnotics.",
    "general_advice": "Drug withdrawal syndrome (or abstinence syndrome) is a set of physical and psychological symptoms that occur when a person who has developed physical dependence on a substance (due to regular, prolonged use) suddenly stops or significantly reduces their intake of that substance. The body has adapted to the presence of the drug, and when it's removed, it reacts with a rebound effect, often producing symptoms opposite to those caused by the drug. Symptoms vary greatly depending on the specific drug, the amount and duration of use, and individual factors. Common withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, depression, irritability, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, sweating, tremors, cravings, and in some cases, more severe symptoms like seizures or psychosis.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are planning to stop using a substance to which you may be dependent, or if you are experiencing withdrawal symptoms, it is crucial to consult a doctor or addiction specialist.

This results in dryness, irritation, and inflammation of the eye surface. When the cause is not readily identifiable from common factors (like aging, medications, environment, or specific diseases), it might be considered idiopathic or of unknown cause pending further investigation. Symptoms of dry eye can include: stinging, burning, or scratchy sensation in the eyes; redness; blurred vision (especially when reading or using screens); sensitivity to light (photophobia); watery eyes (a reflex response to irritation); stringy mucus in or around the eyes; and difficulty wearing contact lenses. It can be a chronic and progressive condition for some.",

If severe symptoms occur after gastric surgery, contact your surgeon or go to an ER.",
    "general_advice": "Dumping syndrome is a condition that can occur after surgery to remove all or part of the stomach (e.g., gastrectomy for cancer or ulcers) or after bariatric (weight-loss) surgery (e.g., gastric bypass). It happens when food, especially sugary or high-carbohydrate food, moves too quickly (is 'dumped') from the stomach into the small intestine (duodenum or jejunum) without being properly digested. This rapid emptying can cause two types of symptoms: 1) Early dumping (occurs 10-30 minutes after eating): Caused by the rapid shift of fluid from the bloodstream into the small intestine to dilute the concentrated food. Symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing, dizziness, lightheadedness, and rapid heartbeat. 2) Late dumping (occurs 1-3 hours after eating): Caused by a rapid rise in blood sugar after absorbing carbohydrates, followed by an excessive release of insulin, leading to reactive hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Symptoms include sweating, weakness, hunger, shakiness, anxiety, confusion, and dizziness.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have had stomach or bariatric surgery and experience symptoms of dumping syndrome, consult your doctor or surgeon. They can confirm the diagnosis and provide guidance on management. Sometimes, further testing may be needed to rule out other conditions.",

    "general_advice": "Eardrum damage, most commonly a perforated or ruptured eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation), is a hole or tear in the thin tissue that separates the ear canal from the middle ear. Causes can include: Middle ear infection (otitis media): Pus buildup can cause the eardrum to rupture. Barotrauma: Sudden changes in air pressure (e.g., during scuba diving, flying, or a forceful slap to the ear). Loud noise (acoustic trauma): A sudden, very loud noise like an explosion or gunshot. Foreign objects in the ear: Poking something too far into the ear canal (e.g., cotton swab, bobby pin). Severe head trauma. Symptoms can include: ear pain (may be sudden and sharp, then subside), clear, pus-like, or bloody drainage from the ear, hearing loss or muffled hearing, ringing in the ear (tinnitus), a whistling sound when blowing the nose, and sometimes dizziness or vertigo.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you have a perforated eardrum, see a doctor (primary care or ENT specialist).

    "general_advice": "Earwax (cerumen) is a natural substance produced by glands in the ear canal. It helps to clean, lubricate, and protect the ear canal by trapping dirt and repelling water. Normally, earwax gradually moves out of the ear canal on its own, carrying debris with it. Earwax impaction occurs when earwax builds up and blocks the ear canal. This can happen if the ear produces too much wax, if the wax is unusually dry or hard, if the ear canal is narrow or oddly shaped, or if attempts to clean the ear (e.g., with cotton swabs) push the wax deeper into the canal. Symptoms of impaction can include: earache or feeling of fullness in the ear, muffled hearing or partial hearing loss in the affected ear, ringing in the ear (tinnitus), dizziness (vertigo), itching in the ear canal, and sometimes a cough (due to nerve stimulation).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of earwax impaction, or if you are unsure if wax is the cause of your symptoms, see a doctor (primary care or ENT specialist). They can safely examine your ear canal and remove impacted wax if necessary (e.g., by manual removal with special instruments, irrigation/syringing, or suction). Do not attempt to remove impacted wax yourself with objects like cotton swabs, bobby pins, or ear candles, as this can push the wax further in, damage the ear canal or eardrum, or cause injury.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If you have a history of mild wax buildup and no eardrum perforation or ear tubes, you can try home remedies to soften wax:",
      "  - Apply a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, hydrogen peroxide (diluted), or commercial earwax softening drops into the ear canal once or twice a day for a few days. This can help soften the wax so it can come out on its own.",
      "  - After softening, you can gently irrigate the ear with a bulb syringe and lukewarm water (be very gentle, and only if you have no history of eardrum problems or ear surgery). Tilt your head to allow water to drain out.",
      "Avoid over-cleaning your ears; earwax is normal and protective.",

It can also occur in the ovary, cervix, or abdominal cavity. An ectopic pregnancy cannot proceed normally and the fertilized egg cannot survive. As the pregnancy grows in an abnormal location, it can cause the structure (e.g., fallopian tube) to rupture, leading to potentially life-threatening internal bleeding. Early symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can be similar to a normal early pregnancy (missed period, breast tenderness, nausea). As it progresses, symptoms may include: light vaginal bleeding or spotting, pelvic or abdominal pain or cramping (often one-sided), and shoulder pain. Risk factors include previous ectopic pregnancy, history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), previous pelvic or tubal surgery, endometriosis, certain STIs, use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception (though overall pregnancy risk is low with IUDs, if pregnancy does occur, it's more likely to be ectopic), and smoking.",

This leaves the inner surface of the eyelid exposed and prone to irritation. It can also prevent tears from draining properly through the tear ducts, as the lower eyelid normally helps to sweep tears towards the drainage system. Causes of ectropion include: age-related weakening of the connective tissues and muscles of the eyelid (most common cause - involutional ectropion), scarring from burns or trauma (cicatricial ectropion), facial nerve palsy (e.g., Bell's palsy, causing muscle weakness - paralytic ectropion), mechanical factors (e.g., a tumor or swelling on the eyelid pulling it down), or congenital factors (rare). Symptoms include excessive tearing (epiphora, as tears don't drain properly), eye dryness, irritation, redness of the eyelid and conjunctiva, a gritty or sandy sensation, light sensitivity, and sometimes blurred vision or recurrent eye infections.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have an eyelid that turns outward and experience bothersome symptoms, consult an eye doctor (ophthalmologist).

There are many types of eczema, including: Atopic dermatitis (most common type, often starts in childhood, associated with allergies/asthma), Contact dermatitis (caused by irritants or allergens - see separate entry), Seborrheic dermatitis (affects oily areas like scalp, face, chest; causes dandruff or greasy, scaly patches), Dyshidrotic eczema (blisters on hands/feet - see separate entry), Nummular eczema (coin-shaped patches of irritated skin), and Stasis dermatitis (affects lower legs due to poor circulation). The exact cause of many types of eczema involves a combination of genetic factors (e.g., filaggrin gene mutations affecting skin barrier), immune system dysfunction, and environmental triggers.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent, bothersome, or severe eczema symptoms that are not well-controlled with self-care, or if you suspect an infection, consult a doctor (primary care or dermatologist). They can diagnose the type of eczema, identify potential triggers, and prescribe appropriate treatments, which may include stronger topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, oral medications (corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics for severe cases), or phototherapy.",

Immediate specialized neonatal/pediatric intensive care is often required from birth.",
    "general_advice": "Edwards syndrome, also known as Trisomy 18, is a rare and severe genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 18. This extra genetic material disrupts normal development, leading to multiple severe congenital malformations affecting virtually every organ system. Characteristic features include: severe intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight, distinctive facial features (e.g., small head - microcephaly, small jaw - micrognathia, low-set ears, prominent back of the head), clenched hands with overlapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet, severe congenital heart defects, kidney abnormalities, gastrointestinal defects, and profound intellectual disability and developmental delays. Sadly, most babies with Trisomy 18 die before or shortly after birth, or within the first year of life, due to life-threatening medical complications. A small percentage may survive longer but with significant health challenges.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Edwards syndrome is often diagnosed prenatally through screening tests (e.g., maternal serum screening, NIPT) and confirmed with diagnostic tests (e.g., chorionic villus sampling - CVS, or amniocentesis, followed by karyotype analysis). If diagnosed, a multidisciplinary team of specialists (geneticists, neonatologists, pediatric cardiologists, palliative care specialists, etc.) will be involved in counseling the parents and planning for care.",

Use your prescribed emergency action plan.",
    "general_advice": "Emphysema is a chronic lung disease and one of the main conditions that make up Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - chronic bronchitis is the other. In emphysema, the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs become damaged and lose their elasticity. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed, leading to fewer, larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This reduces the surface area of the lungs available for gas exchange (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out), making it difficult to breathe. The main cause of emphysema is long-term exposure to irritants, primarily cigarette smoke. Other causes include exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, occupational dusts/chemicals, and rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Symptoms develop gradually and include: shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with activity (progresses to shortness of breath at rest), chronic cough (may or may not produce mucus), wheezing, chest tightness, and unintentional weight loss in later stages. Emphysema is progressive and irreversible, but treatment can help manage symptoms and slow progression.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent respiratory symptoms, especially shortness of breath and a history of smoking, consult a doctor. Emphysema (as part of COPD) is diagnosed based on symptoms, medical history, physical exam, and lung function tests (spirometry is key).

    "general_advice": "Endocarditis, most commonly infective endocarditis (IE), is an infection and inflammation of the endocardium, which is the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves. It usually occurs when bacteria, fungi, or other germs from another part of your body (e.g., mouth, skin, gut) spread through the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart, particularly heart valves. The infection can form vegetations (clumps of bacteria/fungi, platelets, and fibrin) on the valves, which can damage or destroy them and can also break off and travel to other parts of the body (emboli), causing complications like stroke or organ damage. Risk factors include: pre-existing heart valve disease (e.g., rheumatic heart disease, bicuspid aortic valve, prosthetic heart valves), congenital heart defects, history of previous endocarditis, intravenous (IV) drug use, recent dental or medical procedures that can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, and poor dental hygiene. Symptoms can be vague and develop slowly or rapidly, and may include: fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, weakness, muscle or joint aches, pale skin, persistent cough, shortness of breath, new or changed heart murmur, unexplained weight loss, tiny reddish/purple spots on skin (petechiae), tender nodules on fingers/toes (Osler's nodes), painless flat spots on palms/soles (Janeway lesions), or blood in urine.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have risk factors for endocarditis and develop persistent, unexplained fever or other symptoms suggestive of IE, see your doctor promptly. Diagnosis involves blood cultures (to identify the infecting organism), echocardiogram (transthoracic and often transesophageal - TEE, to visualize vegetations and valve damage), EKG, and other tests. Treatment requires hospitalization and long-term antibiotics.",
    "self_care_tips": [

    "general_advice": "Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the endometrium, the lining of the uterus (womb). It's the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs. The vast majority of endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas. The most common symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding, particularly any vaginal bleeding after menopause. In premenopausal women, symptoms can include unusually heavy or prolonged menstrual periods, or bleeding between periods. Other less common symptoms may include abnormal, watery or bloody vaginal discharge, pelvic pain or pressure, or pain during intercourse. Risk factors include: older age (most common after menopause), obesity, unopposed estrogen exposure (e.g., estrogen therapy without progestin, polycystic ovary syndrome - PCOS, estrogen-producing tumors), tamoxifen use (for breast cancer), early menarche/late menopause, never having been pregnant, family history of endometrial or colorectal cancer (e.g., Lynch syndrome), diabetes, and endometrial hyperplasia (see separate entry).",

    "general_advice": "Endometrial hyperplasia is a condition where the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) becomes abnormally thick. It's not cancer, but it can sometimes be a precursor to endometrial cancer, especially if it involves atypical cells (endometrial hyperplasia with atypia). It's usually caused by an imbalance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone, specifically too much estrogen relative to progesterone (unopposed estrogen). Estrogen stimulates the endometrium to grow, while progesterone helps to regulate this growth and prepare the lining for shedding during menstruation. Causes of unopposed estrogen include: perimenopause (when ovulation becomes irregular), obesity (fat cells convert other hormones to estrogen), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), estrogen therapy without adequate progestin, and certain estrogen-producing tumors. The most common symptom is abnormal uterine bleeding, such as heavy or prolonged menstrual periods, bleeding between periods, or any vaginal bleeding after menopause.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding or significant changes in your menstrual pattern, consult your doctor or gynecologist.

Severe pain unresponsive to usual measures also warrants prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Endometriosis is a chronic and often painful condition in which tissue similar to the lining inside the uterus (the endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This misplaced tissue (implants) can be found on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, outer surface of the uterus, pelvic lining, and sometimes on the bowel, bladder, or other organs. Like the uterine lining, these implants respond to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, thickening, breaking down, and bleeding each month. However, because this blood has no way to exit the body, it can cause inflammation, pain, scar tissue formation (adhesions), and cysts (endometriomas, often on ovaries - 'chocolate cysts'). The exact cause is unknown, but theories include retrograde menstruation (menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through fallopian tubes into pelvis), immune system dysfunction, or spread of endometrial cells through blood/lymphatic system. Symptoms vary widely but commonly include: painful periods (dysmenorrhea), chronic pelvic pain, pain during or after sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), pain with bowel movements or urination (especially during periods), heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, nausea (especially during periods), and infertility.",

In adults, they are more common in the spinal cord. These tumors can be benign (slow-growing) or malignant (cancerous, more aggressive), though even benign ependymomas can be serious due to their location and potential to block cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow (leading to hydrocephalus) or press on vital brain/spinal cord structures. Symptoms depend on the tumor's location and size. In the brain, they can cause headaches, nausea/vomiting, balance problems, difficulty with coordination, weakness, seizures, or changes in personality/behavior. In the spinal cord, they can cause back pain, weakness or numbness in limbs, and bowel/bladder dysfunction.",

Prompt evaluation is needed to differentiate and treat appropriately.",
    "general_advice": "Epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis, a coiled tube located at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. It's often caused by a bacterial infection, which can spread from the urethra or bladder. In sexually active men (especially younger men), it's commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia or gonorrhea. In older men or those not sexually active, it's often caused by non-STI bacteria (e.g., *E. coli*) that can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), sometimes related to conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or recent urinary tract procedures. Non-infectious causes (e.g., chemical irritation, trauma, autoimmune) are less common. Symptoms usually develop gradually and include: pain and tenderness in one testicle (often starting at the back and spreading), swelling and redness of the scrotum, warmth in the scrotum, pain or burning during urination (dysuria), frequent or urgent need to urinate, discharge from the penis, and sometimes fever or chills.",

Cranial epidural hematomas are most common and are usually caused by a skull fracture from head trauma (e.g., fall, assault, motor vehicle accident) that tears an artery (often the middle meningeal artery) or a large venous sinus. The bleeding is arterial, so the hematoma can expand rapidly, compressing the brain and increasing intracranial pressure. This can lead to severe brain damage or death if not evacuated quickly. The classic presentation involves a brief loss of consciousness at the time of injury, followed by a 'lucid interval' where the person seems fine, and then a rapid decline in neurological status. However, not everyone has this classic pattern.",

Tardive dyskinesia, while usually chronic, should also be evaluated promptly if new or worsening.",
    "general_advice": "Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are drug-induced movement disorders that arise from the blockade of dopamine receptors in the brain, particularly in the nigrostriatal pathway (part of the extrapyramidal system, which controls motor function). They are most commonly associated with antipsychotic medications (neuroleptics), especially older, first-generation (typical) antipsychotics, but can also occur with some second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (usually at higher doses) and certain antiemetic drugs (like metoclopramide, prochlorperazine). Types of EPS include: 1) Acute dystonia: Sudden, involuntary muscle contractions or spasms (e.g., torticollis - neck twisting, oculogyric crisis - eyes rolling upwards, opisthotonos - arching of back). 2) Akathisia: A state of inner restlessness and inability to sit still; a compelling urge to move. 3) Parkinsonism (drug-induced): Symptoms mimicking Parkinson's disease (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia/slow movement, shuffling gait). 4) Tardive dyskinesia (TD): A late-onset, often irreversible syndrome of involuntary, repetitive movements, typically of the face, tongue, lips (e.g., lip smacking, chewing motions, tongue protrusion), and sometimes limbs or trunk. Can develop after long-term antipsychotic use.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or someone you know develops any new or concerning movement-related symptoms while taking antipsychotic or other implicated medications, contact the prescribing doctor immediately. Do not stop or change medication dosage without medical advice. The doctor may adjust the dose, switch to a different medication with a lower EPS risk, or prescribe medications to treat the EPS (e.g., anticholinergics like benztropine for acute dystonia or parkinsonism; beta-blockers or benzodiazepines for akathisia; VMAT2 inhibitors like valbenazine or deutetrabenazine for tardive dyskinesia).",

This could indicate an underlying acute neurological problem (e.g., stroke, tumor, cranial nerve palsy). In children, any new or persistent eye turn should be evaluated by an eye doctor.",
    "general_advice": "Eye alignment disorder, commonly known as strabismus or squint, is a condition in which the eyes do not look at the same point at the same time; they are misaligned. One eye may turn inward (esotropia - 'crossed eyes'), outward (exotropia - 'wall-eyed'), upward (hypertropia), or downward (hypotropia). Strabismus can be constant or intermittent. It can occur in children or adults. In children, if not corrected, strabismus can lead to amblyopia ('lazy eye'), where the brain suppresses the image from the misaligned eye, resulting in poor vision development in that eye. In adults, new-onset strabismus often causes double vision (diplopia). Causes of strabismus can include: problems with eye muscle control (most common in children), uncorrected refractive errors (farsightedness can cause esotropia), genetic factors, nerve damage (cranial nerve palsies), brain conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, stroke, tumor), eye injuries, or certain systemic diseases (e.g., thyroid eye disease).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice any eye misalignment in your child, or if you develop new-onset strabismus or double vision as an adult, consult an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or pediatric ophthalmologist). Early detection and treatment are crucial, especially in children, to prevent amblyopia and allow for normal binocular vision development. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive eye exam, including tests of eye alignment and movement.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment depends on the type, cause, and severity of strabismus and is guided by an ophthalmologist.",
      "  - Eyeglasses: May be prescribed to correct refractive errors that contribute to strabismus.",

This may involve emergency medical care for the physical harm and/or emergency psychiatric evaluation. If factitious disorder imposed on another (e.g., a child) is suspected, child protective services or law enforcement must be contacted immediately due to risk of abuse.",
    "general_advice": "Factitious disorder is a serious mental health condition in which a person deliberately produces, feigns (fakes), or exaggerates physical or psychological symptoms in themselves (Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self, formerly Munchausen syndrome) or in another person under their care (Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another, formerly Munchausen syndrome by proxy - a form of abuse). The primary motivation is to assume the 'sick role' and gain attention, sympathy, or care from others, not for external rewards like financial gain or avoiding work (which would be malingering). Individuals may go to great lengths to create the appearance of illness, such as tampering with lab samples, injecting substances, falsifying medical records, or inducing injuries/illnesses. They often have extensive medical knowledge and a long history of hospitalizations or medical procedures. The behavior is compulsive and difficult to control.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Diagnosing factitious disorder can be very challenging, as individuals are often deceptive. If suspected, it usually requires careful observation by healthcare professionals and ruling out genuine medical conditions. Once suspected or diagnosed, psychiatric or psychological evaluation and treatment are essential. However, individuals with this disorder are often resistant to acknowledging it or seeking mental health treatment. If factitious disorder imposed on another is suspected, the safety of the potential victim is paramount, and reporting to authorities is mandatory.",

Floaters are very common and are usually caused by age-related changes in the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. As we age, the vitreous can liquefy and shrink, and tiny collagen fibers within it can clump together and cast shadows on the retina, which are perceived as floaters. This process is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and is a common cause of new floaters, especially in middle age and beyond. Most floaters are harmless and become less noticeable over time as the brain learns to ignore them. However, a sudden onset or increase in floaters can sometimes signal a more serious problem.",

Flu is different from the common cold; flu symptoms are usually more severe and come on more suddenly. Symptoms typically include: fever or feeling feverish/chills (though not everyone with flu will have a fever), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headache, fatigue (can be extreme), and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults). Most people recover from the flu within a few days to less than two weeks, but some can develop serious, life-threatening complications.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most healthy people with mild flu do not need to see a doctor. However, consult a doctor if you are at high risk for flu complications (e.g., young children under 5 - especially under 2, adults 65 and older, pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, weakened immune systems), or if your symptoms are severe or concerning. Antiviral medications (e.g., oseltamivir/Tamiflu, baloxavir/Xofluza) may be prescribed if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, especially for high-risk individuals, to shorten illness duration and reduce risk of complications.",

These can be signs of acute heart failure or other critical conditions.",
    "general_advice": "Fluid overload, also known as hypervolemia or fluid retention, occurs when there is too much fluid in the body, particularly in the bloodstream. This can happen if the body's mechanisms for regulating fluid balance are impaired, or if fluid intake exceeds the body's ability to excrete it. It's often a symptom or complication of underlying medical conditions, such as: Heart failure (heart can't pump blood effectively, leading to fluid backup), Kidney disease (kidneys can't excrete enough fluid and sodium), Liver disease/cirrhosis (can lead to fluid accumulation in abdomen - ascites, and legs), certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids, some blood pressure drugs like calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs), hormonal imbalances (e.g., SIADH - syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), or excessive intravenous (IV) fluid administration. Symptoms can include: swelling (edema) in the legs, ankles, feet, hands, or face; rapid weight gain; shortness of breath (especially with exertion or when lying flat); coughing; bloating or abdominal distension (ascites); fatigue; and sometimes high blood pressure or bulging neck veins.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience unexplained swelling, rapid weight gain, or increasing shortness of breath, consult your doctor. It's important to identify and treat the underlying cause of fluid overload.

    "general_advice": "Folate deficiency occurs when the body doesn't have enough folate (vitamin B9), an essential B vitamin. Folate plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and cell growth and division. A deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia (a type of anemia with abnormally large, immature red blood cells), fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, irritability, mouth sores (glossitis - sore, swollen tongue; angular cheilitis - cracks at corners of mouth), and changes in skin, hair, or nail color. In pregnant women, folate deficiency is a major risk factor for neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida, anencephaly) in the developing fetus. Causes of folate deficiency include: inadequate dietary intake (folate is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, beans, fortified grains), malabsorption disorders (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease), increased demand (e.g., during pregnancy, lactation, periods of rapid growth), certain medications (e.g., methotrexate, some anticonvulsants like phenytoin, sulfasalazine), and excessive alcohol consumption.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of folate deficiency or anemia, or if you have risk factors for deficiency (e.g., malabsorption, pregnancy, certain medications), consult your doctor. Diagnosis is made with a blood test to measure folate levels (and often vitamin B12, as deficiencies can coexist and symptoms overlap). A complete blood count (CBC) will show megaloblastic anemia if present.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment involves increasing folate levels through diet and/or supplementation.",
      "  - Folic acid supplements: Your doctor will likely prescribe folic acid tablets. Take as directed.",

      "If the deficiency is due to an underlying condition (e.g., malabsorption, medication), that condition needs to be addressed or medication adjusted if possible.",
      "Avoid excessive alcohol intake.",
      "Women of childbearing age, especially those planning pregnancy, should ensure adequate folic acid intake (often through a prenatal vitamin or separate supplement) to prevent neural tube defects. The recommendation is typically 400 mcg daily for all women of childbearing potential, and higher doses during pregnancy or if there's a history of neural tube defects.",

In severe cases, it can cause anaphylaxis. Common food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews, etc.), milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Food allergies are different from food intolerances (e.g., lactose intolerance), which do not involve the immune system and are generally less severe, though can cause significant discomfort.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you or your child has a food allergy, consult a doctor or allergist. Diagnosis involves a detailed medical history, physical exam, and may include skin prick tests, blood tests (for specific IgE antibodies), or an oral food challenge (done under strict medical supervision). If a food allergy is diagnosed, strict avoidance of the allergenic food is essential.",

    "emergency_advice": "While FRDA is a chronic, progressive condition, seek urgent medical attention for acute complications such as: sudden worsening of cardiac symptoms (chest pain, severe shortness of breath, palpitations, fainting - related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); signs of acute respiratory failure if scoliosis or muscle weakness is severe; or severe complications related to diabetes if present.",
    "general_advice": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare, inherited (autosomal recessive) neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and heart. It's caused by mutations in the FXN gene, leading to a deficiency of the protein frataxin. This deficiency causes damage to parts of the brain (especially the cerebellum and its pathways) and spinal cord, as well as peripheral nerves. Symptoms typically begin in childhood or adolescence (usually between ages 5 and 15, though late-onset forms exist) and progress over time. Key features include: progressive gait ataxia (unsteady, clumsy walking and balance problems), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), loss of coordination in arms and legs (dysmetria), muscle weakness (especially in legs), loss of sensation (vibration and position sense) in limbs, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and skeletal deformities (e.g., scoliosis - curvature of the spine, pes cavus - high-arched feet). A significant proportion of individuals also develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of the heart muscle), diabetes mellitus, and sometimes vision or hearing impairment.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a child or young adult develops progressive problems with balance, coordination, walking, or speech, consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist). Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, neurological exam, family history, and confirmed by genetic testing for mutations in the FXN gene. EMG/nerve conduction studies, MRI, echocardiogram, and other tests may be done to assess specific aspects.",

It's most common in children but can affect adults. It's contagious and can spread through direct contact with an infected person or animal (cats, dogs, farm animals), or indirectly through contaminated objects like combs, brushes, hats, towels, or bedding. Symptoms can vary but often include: itchy scalp, scaly patches (may be red or grayish, sometimes with a ring-like appearance), areas of hair loss or broken hairs (may leave black dots where hairs have broken off at the scalp surface), and sometimes dandruff-like flaking. In some cases, a more severe inflammatory reaction called a kerion can develop, which is a boggy, tender, pus-filled swelling that can lead to permanent scarring and hair loss if not treated promptly.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has symptoms of tinea capitis, consult a doctor or dermatologist. Diagnosis is often made by clinical appearance, but may involve examining skin scrapings or plucked hairs under a microscope (KOH prep) or fungal culture.

Severe hemolysis can lead to life-threatening anemia and kidney failure.",
    "general_advice": "G6PD deficiency is a common inherited (X-linked recessive) genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce enough of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This enzyme helps red blood cells function properly and protects them from damage caused by oxidative stress (from certain substances or infections). When red blood cells are exposed to oxidative stress without enough G6PD, they can break down prematurely (hemolysis), leading to hemolytic anemia. Most people with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic and unaware they have it unless they are exposed to a trigger. Triggers can include: certain medications (e.g., some antibiotics like sulfonamides, antimalarials like primaquine, aspirin in high doses, nitrofurantoin), fava beans (favism), certain infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonia), and severe stress. Symptoms of hemolysis include fatigue, pallor, jaundice, dark urine, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and sometimes an enlarged spleen.",

Also, if there's bloody nipple discharge or a breast lump, prompt evaluation is needed to rule out breast cancer.",
    "general_advice": "Galactorrhea is the production and leakage of a milky nipple discharge in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding, or in men. It can occur in one or both breasts. When the cause is not readily identified after a standard evaluation, it may be considered idiopathic or of unknown cause. However, a thorough investigation is always needed to rule out underlying causes. Common causes of galactorrhea include: 1) High levels of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia): Prolactin is the hormone responsible for milk production. This can be due to a benign pituitary tumor (prolactinoma), certain medications (e.g., some antipsychotics, antidepressants, antihypertensives, opioids), hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, or chest wall injury/stimulation. 2) Hormonal imbalances. 3) Excessive breast stimulation (e.g., frequent self-examination, sexual activity, irritation from clothing). 4) Stress. 5) Certain herbal supplements. The discharge is typically milky white or clear, but can sometimes be yellowish or greenish.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience nipple discharge that is not breast milk during pregnancy or lactation, consult your doctor (primary care, gynecologist, or endocrinologist). They will take a medical history, perform a breast exam, and likely order blood tests (e.g., prolactin level, thyroid function tests, pregnancy test). Imaging of the pituitary gland (MRI) may be done if prolactin levels are high or a pituitary tumor is suspected. If discharge is bloody or associated with a lump, mammogram/ultrasound and possibly biopsy will be needed.",

These could indicate cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation), cholangitis (bile duct infection), pancreatitis, or a stone blocking a bile duct.",
    "general_advice": "Gallstones (cholelithiasis) are hardened deposits of digestive fluid (bile) that can form in the gallbladder, a small organ located beneath the liver that stores and releases bile. Gallstones can vary in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. There are two main types: 1) Cholesterol stones: Most common, usually yellow-green, form when bile contains too much cholesterol, too little bile salts, or the gallbladder doesn't empty properly. 2) Pigment stones: Smaller and darker, made of bilirubin (a substance produced when red blood cells break down). More common in people with cirrhosis, biliary tract infections, or certain blood disorders. Many people with gallstones have no symptoms ('silent stones'). When symptoms occur (often called a 'gallbladder attack' or biliary colic), it's usually because a stone temporarily blocks the cystic duct (tube leading from gallbladder). This typically causes sudden, rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right or center of the abdomen, often radiating to the right shoulder or between the shoulder blades. Pain may last from 30 minutes to several hours and is often triggered by fatty meals. Nausea and vomiting may accompany the pain. Risk factors include female sex, age over 40, obesity, rapid weight loss, pregnancy, family history, diabetes, high-fat/low-fiber diet, and certain medications (e.g., estrogen).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of a gallbladder attack, consult your doctor. Diagnosis is usually made with an ultrasound of the abdomen. If complications are suspected, other tests (e.g., HIDA scan, CT, MRCP, ERCP) may be done.",

    "general_advice": "A ganglion cyst is a non-cancerous, fluid-filled lump or sac that commonly develops along tendons or joints, most often on the wrists (top or palm side), hands, fingers, or sometimes ankles and feet. The cyst is filled with a thick, jelly-like fluid similar to synovial fluid (joint lubricating fluid). The exact cause is often unknown, but they may arise from trauma, overuse, or degeneration of joint or tendon sheath tissue, leading to a small tear or outpouching that fills with fluid. Ganglion cysts can vary in size, may appear suddenly or grow gradually, and can fluctuate in size or even disappear on their own. They are usually round or oval and can feel firm or soft. Many are asymptomatic, but some can cause pain (especially if they press on a nearby nerve), tenderness, aching, weakness, or interfere with joint movement depending on their size and location.",

GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a muscular ring at the bottom of the esophagus, weakens or relaxes inappropriately, allowing stomach contents to reflux. Common symptoms include: heartburn (a burning sensation in the chest, often after eating or when lying down), acid regurgitation (sour or bitter taste in the mouth/throat), chest pain (non-cardiac), difficulty swallowing, sensation of a lump in the throat, chronic cough, laryngitis, hoarseness, or new/worsening asthma. Risk factors include obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, smoking, certain foods/drinks (fatty/fried foods, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, spicy/acidic foods), large meals, eating late at night, and some medications.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience frequent or severe GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn more than twice a week, symptoms interfering with daily life, or difficulty swallowing), consult your doctor (primary care or gastroenterologist). Chronic, untreated GERD can lead to complications like esophagitis, esophageal strictures, Barrett's esophagus (a precancerous condition), or esophageal cancer. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, but may involve endoscopy, esophageal pH monitoring, or manometry.",

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience: vomiting blood (hematemesis - can be bright red, dark red, or look like coffee grounds); passing black, tarry, foul-smelling stools (melena - indicates upper GI bleeding); passing bright red or maroon blood from the rectum (hematochezia - usually lower GI bleeding, but can be rapid upper GI bleed); accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, pale skin, sweating, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, confusion, or loss of consciousness (signs of significant blood loss and shock).",
    "general_advice": "Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage refers to bleeding anywhere in the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the rectum. It's a symptom of an underlying condition, not a disease itself. Upper GI bleeding (from esophagus, stomach, duodenum) is more common than lower GI bleeding (from small intestine, colon, rectum, anus). Causes of upper GI bleeding include: peptic ulcers (most common), esophageal varices (often from liver cirrhosis), Mallory-Weiss tears (tears in esophageal lining from forceful vomiting), esophagitis, gastritis, or tumors. Causes of lower GI bleeding include: diverticular disease (diverticulosis/diverticulitis), hemorrhoids, anal fissures, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis), polyps, colorectal cancer, angiodysplasia (abnormal blood vessels), or infections.

    "general_advice": "Gastroparesis, also known as delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine. This is not due to a physical blockage but rather to impaired stomach muscle function (motility), often involving damage to the vagus nerve, which controls stomach muscle contractions. The most common identifiable cause is diabetes (diabetic gastroparesis). Other causes include complications from some surgeries (e.g., gastric surgery, vagotomy), certain medications (e.g., opioids, some antidepressants, anticholinergics), viral infections, neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis), smooth muscle disorders (e.g., scleroderma), or idiopathic (unknown cause, common). Symptoms can include: nausea, vomiting (often undigested food hours after eating), early satiety (feeling full quickly), abdominal pain or bloating, heartburn, lack of appetite, weight loss, and fluctuations in blood sugar levels (as food absorption is unpredictable).",

    "general_advice": "Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is the more common cause of genital herpes, but HSV-1 (which usually causes oral herpes/cold sores) can also cause genital herpes through oral-genital contact. Many people with genital herpes have no symptoms or very mild symptoms that go unrecognized. When symptoms do occur (an 'outbreak'), they typically involve one or more painful blisters or open sores (ulcers) on or around the genitals (penis, vulva, vagina, cervix, anus), buttocks, or inner thighs. Before the blisters appear, there may be tingling, itching, or pain in the area. Outbreaks can also be accompanied by flu-like symptoms (fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes in groin) during the first episode. The blisters rupture, ooze, and then crust over and heal, usually within 2-4 weeks. After the initial infection, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate periodically, causing recurrent outbreaks, which are often shorter and less severe than the first. Triggers for recurrences can include stress, illness, fatigue, menstruation, or friction.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you have genital herpes (e.g., sores or blisters on genitals), see a doctor or go to an STI clinic. Diagnosis is best made by taking a swab from a fresh lesion for viral culture or PCR testing. Blood tests (for HSV antibodies) can detect past infection but may not distinguish between oral and genital herpes or pinpoint the timing of infection. There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications can help manage outbreaks.",

Also, any concerns about fetal well-being (e.g., significantly decreased fetal movement) require urgent evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women who did not previously have diabetes. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin (a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose get into cells for energy) to meet the increased demands of pregnancy, leading to high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Hormones produced by the placenta can also contribute to insulin resistance. GDM usually develops in the second or third trimester and often has no obvious symptoms, which is why screening is important. If symptoms do occur, they might include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, or blurred vision. Uncontrolled GDM can lead to complications for both the mother (e.g., preeclampsia, increased risk of C-section, developing type 2 diabetes later in life) and the baby (e.g., excessive birth weight/macrosomia leading to birth injuries, premature birth, low blood sugar/hypoglycemia after birth, respiratory distress syndrome, increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life).",

This is sight-threatening. For chronic glaucoma, sudden significant vision changes also warrant urgent evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, leading to progressive and irreversible vision loss, typically starting with peripheral (side) vision. It's often, but not always, associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP - pressure inside the eye). The most common type is Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG - see 'Chronic Glaucoma'), which is usually painless and develops slowly. Angle-Closure Glaucoma (ACG) occurs when the drainage angle in the eye becomes blocked, preventing fluid from draining properly; it can be acute (sudden, painful - an emergency) or chronic (gradual). Other types include Normal-Tension Glaucoma (optic nerve damage despite normal IOP), Congenital Glaucoma (present at birth), and Secondary Glaucoma (caused by other conditions like eye injury, inflammation, tumors, or medications like steroids). Untreated glaucoma can lead to blindness.",

If the person has an emergency steroid injection kit (e.g., hydrocortisone), administer it as instructed and still call for emergency help.",
    "general_advice": "Glucocorticoid deficiency, also known as adrenal insufficiency, occurs when the adrenal glands (located on top of the kidneys) do not produce enough glucocorticoid hormones, primarily cortisol. Cortisol plays a vital role in regulating stress response, metabolism, immune function, and blood pressure. There are two main types: 1) Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease): The adrenal glands themselves are damaged (often by an autoimmune process, but also by infections like TB, cancer, or bleeding). This usually involves deficiency of both cortisol and aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid that regulates salt/water balance). 2) Secondary adrenal insufficiency: The pituitary gland (in the brain) doesn't produce enough ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), which normally stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. This can be due to pituitary tumors, surgery, radiation, or abrupt cessation of long-term high-dose corticosteroid medication (which suppresses natural ACTH/cortisol production). Symptoms of chronic adrenal insufficiency develop gradually and can include: progressive fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, low blood pressure (especially orthostatic hypotension - dizziness upon standing), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, salt craving (in Addison's), darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation, especially in skin creases, scars, gums - characteristic of Addison's), irritability, and depression.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure cortisol and ACTH levels, and often an ACTH stimulation test (to see how adrenal glands respond).",

This could indicate rapid enlargement or compression of the airway or esophagus.",
    "general_advice": "A goiter is an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, the butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that regulate metabolism. A goiter can occur when the thyroid gland is overactive (hyperthyroidism, e.g., Graves' disease), underactive (hypothyroidism, e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis), or functioning normally (euthyroid). Causes include: Iodine deficiency (most common cause worldwide, but less so in areas with iodized salt), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune inflammation causing hypothyroidism, can initially cause goiter), Graves' disease (autoimmune condition causing hyperthyroidism and often diffuse goiter), thyroid nodules (single or multiple lumps in the thyroid, can cause goiter if large or numerous - multinodular goiter), thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid from other causes), pregnancy (hormonal changes can cause mild enlargement), or rarely, thyroid cancer.

Untreated, severe gout can lead to joint damage and kidney problems.",
    "general_advice": "Gout is a common and complex form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, often affecting the big toe (podagra). It's caused by hyperuricemia, which is an elevated level of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a waste product formed from the breakdown of purines (substances found naturally in the body and in certain foods). When uric acid levels are too high, urate crystals can form and deposit in joints and surrounding tissues, triggering an intense inflammatory response (a gout attack). Attacks often begin suddenly, frequently at night. If untreated, gout can become chronic, leading to more frequent and prolonged attacks, joint damage (gouty arthritis), and the formation of tophi (chalky deposits of urate crystals under the skin, often around joints, ears, or kidneys). Risk factors include: diet high in purines (red meat, organ meats, seafood like shellfish, anchovies, sardines), alcohol (especially beer and spirits), sugary drinks (fructose), obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, certain medications (e.g., diuretics, low-dose aspirin), and family history/genetics.",

The infection typically begins as small, painless nodules or papules that slowly enlarge and then break down to form beefy-red, velvety, raised, ulcerative lesions that bleed easily. These lesions are often described as 'granulomatous' and can gradually spread and destroy surrounding tissue if untreated. Unlike some other STIs, there is usually no associated lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop any persistent sores, ulcers, or unusual growths in the genital or groin area, consult a doctor or go to an STI clinic. Diagnosis is made by identifying Donovan bodies (bacteria within host cells) in tissue samples (smear or biopsy) taken from a lesion. Treatment with antibiotics is necessary to cure the infection and prevent further tissue damage and scarring.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If diagnosed with granuloma inguinale, take all prescribed antibiotics exactly as directed by your doctor. Treatment often involves a prolonged course (e.g., several weeks or until lesions have completely healed) of antibiotics like doxycycline, azithromycin, or ciprofloxacin.",
      "Keep the affected area clean and dry.",
      "Avoid sexual contact until you and any sexual partner(s) have completed treatment and lesions have fully healed.",

    "emergency_advice": "A 'thyroid storm' (thyrotoxic crisis) is a rare but life-threatening complication of severe, untreated or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism (often from Graves' disease), often precipitated by stress, infection, or surgery. Seek immediate emergency medical attention for: high fever, very rapid heartbeat (tachycardia, often >140 bpm), agitation, confusion, delirium, profuse sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, and sometimes heart failure or coma. Also, severe eye symptoms (Graves' ophthalmopathy) like significant proptosis (bulging eyes) causing inability to close eyes, severe eye pain, or vision loss need urgent ophthalmological care.",
    "general_advice": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland). In Graves' disease, the immune system produces antibodies (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins - TSIs) that mimic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), causing the thyroid gland to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). This leads to a sped-up metabolism and a wide range of symptoms, including: unintentional weight loss despite increased appetite, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation), nervousness, anxiety, irritability, tremors (fine shaking, often in hands), heat intolerance, increased sweating, fatigue, muscle weakness, changes in bowel habits (more frequent), goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), and sometimes sleep disturbances. Many people with Graves' disease also develop Graves' ophthalmopathy (thyroid eye disease - TED), which causes inflammation and swelling of tissues behind the eyes, leading to bulging eyes (proptosis), eye pain/pressure, double vision, redness, gritty sensation, and sometimes vision loss. A less common skin condition called Graves' dermopathy (pretibial myxedema - thick, reddish skin on shins) can also occur.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist).

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience rapidly ascending weakness or paralysis (often starting in legs and moving up), difficulty breathing or swallowing, severe pain, or autonomic dysfunction (e.g., unstable blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms). Hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit (ICU), is usually required for monitoring and treatment.",
    "general_advice": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system (the network of nerves outside the brain and spinal cord). This leads to inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath (insulation around nerve fibers) and sometimes the nerve axons themselves, impairing nerve signal transmission. GBS often follows a viral or bacterial infection (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni - common foodborne bacteria, influenza, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Zika virus) by a few days or weeks. The hallmark symptom is rapidly developing, usually symmetrical, muscle weakness, often starting in the legs and ascending to the arms and face. This can progress to paralysis. Other symptoms can include: tingling or numbness (paresthesias) in hands and feet, loss of reflexes, severe pain (neuropathic or musculoskeletal), difficulty with eye movements, facial weakness, difficulty swallowing or speaking, and problems with autonomic nervous system function (e.g., fluctuations in blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, bowel/bladder dysfunction).",

Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG or 'trench mouth') is a severe form requiring prompt treatment.",
    "general_advice": "Gum disease is an inflammation of the gums (gingiva) that can progress to affect the bone that surrounds and supports your teeth. It's primarily caused by bacteria in dental plaque, a sticky film that constantly forms on teeth. There are two main stages: 1) Gingivitis: The early, milder stage, where gums become red, swollen, and may bleed easily (e.g., when brushing or flossing). At this stage, the bone and connective tissue holding teeth in place are not yet affected, and it's reversible with good oral hygiene and professional cleaning. 2) Periodontitis: If gingivitis is untreated, it can advance to periodontitis. In periodontitis, the inflammation spreads below the gum line, causing gums to pull away from the teeth, forming pockets that become infected. The body's immune response to the bacteria and toxins can lead to breakdown of the bone and connective tissue that support the teeth. Teeth may become loose, shift, or eventually be lost. Symptoms of periodontitis include: swollen, red, tender, or bleeding gums; receding gums (teeth appear longer); persistent bad breath or bad taste; pus between teeth and gums; pain when chewing; loose teeth; and changes in the way teeth fit together when biting. Risk factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, diabetes, hormonal changes (e.g., pregnancy), certain medications, genetic susceptibility, and weakened immune system.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have any signs of gum disease, see your dentist or periodontist (gum specialist). Regular dental check-ups and professional cleanings are essential for preventing and managing gum disease. Treatment depends on the stage and severity.",

Also, if gynecomastia is causing significant pain or psychological distress.",
    "general_advice": "Gynecomastia is the enlargement of breast gland tissue in boys or men, caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Estrogen causes breast tissue to grow, while testosterone inhibits it. Gynecomastia is common and can occur at different life stages: 1) Neonatal: Due to maternal estrogen exposure in utero; usually resolves within weeks. 2) Pubertal: Due to hormonal fluctuations during puberty; often resolves on its own within months to a couple of years. 3) Senile (older men): Due to declining testosterone levels with age. Other causes can include: certain medications (e.g., some anti-androgens, anabolic steroids, some ulcer/heartburn drugs like cimetidine, some AIDS medications, some psychiatric drugs), illicit drugs (e.g., alcohol, marijuana, heroin, amphetamines), underlying medical conditions (e.g., hypogonadism - low testosterone, kidney failure, liver disease/cirrhosis, thyroid disorders, tumors of testes/adrenals/pituitary), obesity (can cause pseudogynecomastia - fat deposition without true gland enlargement, or true gynecomastia due to hormonal changes), or malnutrition/refeeding. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly. It may be asymptomatic or cause breast tenderness, pain, or nipple sensitivity.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice breast enlargement, tenderness, or a lump, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). They will take a medical history, perform a physical exam (to differentiate true gynecomastia from pseudogynecomastia and rule out breast cancer), and may order blood tests (hormone levels, liver/kidney/thyroid function) or imaging (mammogram or ultrasound if a lump is suspicious) to determine the cause.",
    "self_care_tips": [

    "general_advice": "A hammer toe is a deformity of a toe (usually the second, third, or fourth toe) in which the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal - PIP joint) is bent downward, causing the toe to look like an upside-down 'V' or a hammer. This can lead to pain, rubbing against shoes, and the formation of corns or calluses on the top of the bent joint or at the tip of the toe. Hammer toes often develop due to an imbalance in the muscles, tendons, or ligaments that normally keep the toe straight. Common causes include: wearing shoes that are too tight, narrow, or have high heels, which can crowd the toes; a toe that is longer than the big toe (second toe hammer toe is common); trauma or injury to the toe; arthritis; or certain neurological conditions. In early stages, a hammer toe may be flexible (can be manually straightened), but over time it can become rigid (fixed in the bent position).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a hammer toe that is painful, causing corns/calluses, or interfering with wearing shoes or walking, consult a doctor (primary care, podiatrist, or orthopedic foot specialist). They can assess the deformity and recommend appropriate treatment.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Wear comfortable, properly fitting shoes with a wide and deep toe box to accommodate the bent toe and reduce pressure. Avoid tight, narrow, or high-heeled shoes.",
      "Use over-the-counter corn pads or cushions to protect prominent areas and reduce friction.",
      "Gently stretch the affected toe if it's still flexible.",
      "If corns or calluses develop, you can gently file them down with a pumice stone after soaking the foot in warm water. Do not try to cut them yourself, especially if you have diabetes.",
      "Shoe inserts (orthotics) or toe splints/straps may be recommended by your doctor or podiatrist to help reposition the toe or relieve pressure.",
      "If conservative measures don't relieve pain or if the deformity is severe or rigid, surgical correction may be considered. Surgery can involve releasing tight tendons, removing a small piece of bone, or fusing the joint to straighten the toe."

Also, if experiencing acute, severe symptoms related to an associated goiter (e.g., difficulty breathing/swallowing).",
    "general_advice": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and gradually destroys the thyroid gland. This leads to chronic inflammation of the thyroid and often results in an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), where the thyroid gland cannot produce enough thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) to meet the body's needs. Hashimoto's is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas with sufficient iodine intake. It's more common in women and often has a genetic component. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms, or the thyroid gland may be enlarged (goiter) but functioning normally or even slightly overactive (hashitoxicosis, transient). As the disease progresses and hypothyroidism develops, symptoms can include: fatigue, sluggishness, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, unexplained weight gain, dry skin, hair loss or thinning/brittle hair, puffy face, hoarse voice, muscle aches/weakness/stiffness, joint pain/stiffness, heavy or irregular menstrual periods, depression, impaired memory or concentration ('brain fog'), and an enlarged thyroid (goiter).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism or have a goiter, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels (TSH - usually high in hypothyroidism, and free T4 - usually low) and thyroid antibody tests (anti-thyroid peroxidase - TPO antibodies, and anti-thyroglobulin - Tg antibodies, which are usually elevated in Hashimoto's). A thyroid ultrasound may also be done.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If hypothyroidism develops, treatment involves lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine (a synthetic form of T4). Take levothyroxine as prescribed, usually once daily on an empty stomach (e.g., 30-60 minutes before breakfast or several hours after dinner) to ensure proper absorption. Avoid taking it with certain medications or supplements (e.g., iron, calcium, antacids) that can interfere with absorption; discuss timing with your doctor or pharmacist.",

These could indicate a more serious complication like meningitis or intracranial hematoma (though rare).",
    "general_advice": "A post-lumbar puncture headache (PDPH), also known as a spinal headache, is a common complication that can occur after a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), a procedure where a needle is inserted into the lower back to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or administer medication. PDPH is thought to be caused by leakage of CSF through the puncture site in the dura mater (the membrane surrounding the spinal cord), leading to a decrease in CSF pressure and volume, which can cause the brain to sag slightly and pull on pain-sensitive structures. The headache is typically positional: it worsens significantly when sitting or standing up and is relieved or improves when lying flat. It's often described as throbbing or dull and may be located in the front (frontal) or back (occipital) of the head. It can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, dizziness, stiff neck, light sensitivity (photophobia), sound sensitivity (phonophobia), or blurred/double vision. Symptoms usually begin within 6 to 72 hours after the procedure.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop a headache after a lumbar puncture, especially if it's positional, contact the doctor who performed the procedure or your primary care doctor.

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention if heart block causes: severe dizziness, fainting (syncope) or near-fainting, extreme fatigue or weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a very slow heart rate (bradycardia) leading to significant symptoms. High-degree AV block (second-degree Mobitz II or third-degree/complete heart block) can be life-threatening and requires urgent management.",
    "general_advice": "Heart block, specifically atrioventricular (AV) block, is a type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) where the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are partially or completely blocked as they travel from the atria (upper chambers of the heart) to the ventricles (lower chambers). This can cause the heart to beat too slowly or irregularly, reducing blood flow to the brain and other organs. There are different degrees of AV block: 1) First-degree AV block: Electrical signals are slowed but all reach the ventricles; often asymptomatic and may not require treatment. 2) Second-degree AV block: Some signals don't reach the ventricles, causing skipped beats. Type I (Mobitz I or Wenckebach) is often less serious. Type II (Mobitz II) is more serious and can progress to complete heart block. 3) Third-degree AV block (Complete Heart Block): No electrical signals from the atria reach the ventricles. The atria and ventricles beat independently, with the ventricles usually contracting at a very slow escape rhythm. This is a serious condition. Causes of heart block can include damage to the heart's electrical system from coronary artery disease, heart attack, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, congenital heart defects, certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin), electrolyte imbalances, or age-related degeneration.",

They typically grow rapidly for the first few months (proliferative phase), then stabilize, and then slowly shrink and fade over several years (involuting phase), often disappearing by age 5-10, though some may leave residual skin changes or scarring. They can be superficial (bright red, raised), deep (bluish, under the skin), or mixed. Most are small and cause no problems, but large IHs or those in critical locations (e.g., near eyes, nose, mouth, airway, diaper area) can cause complications (e.g., vision obstruction, breathing problems, feeding difficulties, ulceration, bleeding). 2) Cherry angiomas: Small, bright red, benign skin growths that appear in adults, usually on the trunk.

This iron overload can damage these organs over time if not treated. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common form, caused by genetic mutations (most often in the HFE gene) that affect iron regulation. Secondary hemochromatosis can occur due to other conditions like chronic liver diseases, certain anemias requiring frequent blood transfusions (e.g., thalassemia), or excessive iron supplementation. Many people with hemochromatosis, especially in early stages, have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can be vague and include: fatigue, weakness, joint pain (arthralgia, often in hands/knuckles), abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, loss of libido, and skin bronzing or graying.

Seek immediate emergency medical attention or go to your hemophilia treatment center (HTC) for: any significant injury (especially to the head); unexplained or uncontrolled bleeding; severe pain or swelling in a joint or muscle; severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting, or neurological changes (could be intracranial bleed); blood in urine or stool; or abdominal pain with swelling. Administer prescribed clotting factor concentrate immediately if you have it and are trained to do so for a significant bleed, but still seek medical care.",
    "general_advice": "Hemophilia is a rare, inherited (usually X-linked recessive, so primarily affects males) bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly due to a deficiency or absence of specific clotting factor proteins. Hemophilia A (classic hemophilia) is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX (FIX). The severity of hemophilia (mild, moderate, or severe) depends on the amount of clotting factor present in the blood. People with hemophilia bleed for a longer time after an injury or surgery, and can also experience spontaneous bleeding, especially into joints (hemarthrosis - common in knees, elbows, ankles) and muscles. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to chronic pain, joint damage (hemophilic arthropathy), and disability. Bleeding into other areas (e.g., brain, internal organs) can be life-threatening.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Hemophilia is usually diagnosed in childhood, often after unexplained bleeding episodes or if there's a family history. Diagnosis is made with blood tests to measure clotting factor levels. Management should be coordinated through a specialized Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) with a multidisciplinary team.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "The mainstay of treatment is clotting factor replacement therapy: Infusions of concentrated clotting factor (FVIII or FIX) to replace the deficient factor. This can be given: 1) On-demand: To treat an active bleed. 2) Prophylactically: On a regular schedule (e.g., 2-3 times a week) to prevent bleeds, especially in severe hemophilia.

Seek emergency medical attention if a person with liver disease develops: significant confusion, disorientation, extreme drowsiness or lethargy, slurred speech, agitation, personality changes, seizures, or unresponsiveness. Even milder new or worsening HE symptoms warrant prompt medical evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric abnormalities that occur in people with advanced liver disease (acute liver failure or, more commonly, chronic liver disease/cirrhosis). It happens when the liver is too damaged to effectively remove toxins (like ammonia, produced by gut bacteria during protein digestion) from the blood. These toxins then travel to the brain and interfere with brain function. Symptoms can range from mild (subtle changes in thinking, mild confusion, mood changes, sleep disturbances - 'minimal HE') to severe (marked confusion, disorientation, drowsiness, slurred speech, personality changes, asterixis - a 'flapping tremor' of the hands, poor coordination, stupor, and coma). HE can be precipitated or worsened by factors like infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, certain medications (e.g., sedatives, diuretics), or excessive dietary protein in some cases.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a person with known liver disease develops any new or worsening neurological or mental status changes, they should be evaluated by their doctor (hepatologist/gastroenterologist) or go to an emergency department promptly.

    "general_advice": "A herniated disc (also called a slipped, ruptured, or bulging disc) occurs when the soft, gel-like center (nucleus pulposus) of an intervertebral disc pushes out through a tear or weak spot in the disc's tough outer layer (annulus fibrosus). Intervertebral discs act as cushions between the vertebrae (bones) of the spine. A herniated disc can occur in any part of the spine but is most common in the lumbar (lower back) and cervical (neck) regions. If the herniated disc material presses on a nearby spinal nerve root or the spinal cord, it can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the area of the body supplied by that nerve. Lumbar herniated disc often causes sciatica (pain radiating down the buttock and leg along the sciatic nerve). Cervical herniated disc can cause pain, numbness, or weakness radiating into the shoulder, arm, and hand. Herniation can result from gradual wear and tear (disc degeneration) with aging, or from a sudden strain or injury (e.g., improper lifting, twisting).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have back or neck pain that radiates into a limb, or is accompanied by numbness, tingling, or weakness, consult a doctor (primary care, physiatrist, orthopedist, or neurosurgeon).

    "general_advice": "A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach bulges up through an opening in your diaphragm (the hiatus) and into your chest cavity. The diaphragm is a large muscle that separates your abdomen from your chest and helps with breathing. There are two main types: 1) Sliding hiatal hernia (most common): The stomach and the section of the esophagus that joins the stomach slide up into the chest through the hiatus. 2) Paraesophageal hiatal hernia (less common but potentially more serious): Part of the stomach squeezes up through the hiatus alongside the esophagus, remaining next to it. Many small hiatal hernias cause no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are often related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) because the hernia can weaken the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing stomach acid to reflux into the esophagus. Symptoms can include: heartburn, acid regurgitation, chest pain or discomfort (can mimic heart pain), difficulty swallowing, belching, feeling of fullness after eating, and sometimes shortness of breath or nausea. Risk factors include age over 50, obesity, and conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., chronic coughing, straining, heavy lifting, pregnancy).",

Also, if a newborn fails to pass meconium within 24-48 hours of birth, or shows signs of intestinal obstruction (vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation).",
    "general_advice": "Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital condition affecting the large intestine (colon) that causes problems with passing stool. It occurs when nerve cells (ganglion cells) are missing from the muscles in a segment of the colon. These nerve cells are essential for normal bowel motility (the coordinated muscle contractions that move stool through the intestine). Without these nerves, the affected segment of the colon cannot relax and effectively push stool along, leading to a functional obstruction. The length of the affected segment can vary, from a short segment near the anus (most common) to the entire colon (rare). Symptoms usually appear shortly after birth, with most newborns failing to pass meconium (first stool) within the first 24-48 hours. Other symptoms in infants can include: abdominal swelling or distension, vomiting (may be green or brown), constipation or difficulty passing stool, poor feeding, and failure to thrive.

This fungus is commonly found in soil enriched with bird or bat droppings, particularly in certain river valleys (e.g., Ohio and Mississippi River valleys in the US, parts of Central/South America, Africa, Asia, Australia). Most people who inhale the spores do not get sick or only develop a mild, self-limiting, flu-like illness (acute pulmonary histoplasmosis) with symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, chills, headache, chest pain, and body aches, which usually resolve without treatment within a few weeks. However, in some individuals, especially those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, on immunosuppressive drugs), infants, or older adults, the infection can become severe and spread throughout the body (progressive disseminated histoplasmosis - PDH), affecting organs like the lungs, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, bone marrow, and central nervous system.

    "general_advice": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common group of related viruses. There are many different types of HPV, some of which can cause warts (papillomas) on various parts of the body, while others can lead to cancer. HPV is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact, most commonly during sexual activity (vaginal, anal, or oral sex). Most HPV infections cause no symptoms and clear on their own within a couple of years without causing health problems. However, persistent infection with certain high-risk HPV types can cause cellular changes that, over many years, can lead to cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of tongue and tonsils). Low-risk HPV types can cause genital warts (condyloma acuminata) - soft, fleshy growths on or around the genitals or anus - or common skin warts. There is no cure for the HPV virus itself once infection occurs, but the health problems it causes (warts, precancerous changes, cancer) can be treated.",

Also, if there's a high-risk exposure to HIV (e.g., unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner, needle stick), seek immediate medical care to discuss post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which must be started within 72 hours.",
    "general_advice": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells), which are crucial for fighting off infections. If left untreated, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system, leading to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely weakened, making the person highly susceptible to opportunistic infections (infections that wouldn't normally cause illness in people with healthy immune systems) and certain cancers. HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual contact (anal or vaginal), sharing contaminated needles or syringes (for IV drug use), or from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Early HIV infection may cause flu-like symptoms (fever, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, rash) within 2-4 weeks of exposure (acute retroviral syndrome), or it may be asymptomatic. Without treatment, HIV progresses through a chronic (latent) phase (often asymptomatic for years) to AIDS.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Get tested for HIV if you have engaged in any risk behaviors or if you have symptoms. Regular HIV testing is recommended for sexually active individuals and those with risk factors. If diagnosed with HIV, it is crucial to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 count. ART involves taking a combination of HIV medicines daily. While ART does not cure HIV, it can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, allowing the immune system to recover, preventing progression to AIDS, significantly improving health and lifespan, and preventing transmission to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U). Management should be by a doctor specializing in HIV care.",

Complications like hemorrhage or persistent trophoblastic disease require urgent management.",
    "general_advice": "A hydatidiform mole, commonly known as a molar pregnancy, is a rare complication of pregnancy characterized by abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue (the tissue that normally develops into the placenta) in the uterus. Instead of a viable fetus, a mass of abnormal tissue (often described as resembling a cluster of grapes) forms. There are two main types: 1) Complete hydatidiform mole: An egg with no genetic information is fertilized by one or two sperm, resulting in placental tissue with no fetus. 2) Partial hydatidiform mole: A normal egg is fertilized by two sperm (or one sperm that duplicates its chromosomes), resulting in abnormal placental tissue and often an abnormal, non-viable fetus. Molar pregnancies produce very high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the pregnancy hormone. Symptoms can include: vaginal bleeding (often dark brown to bright red, may be intermittent or continuous, can occur in first or early second trimester), severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum), larger-than-expected uterine size for gestational age, passage of grape-like vesicles from the vagina, and sometimes early development of preeclampsia or hyperthyroidism (due to hCG stimulation).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are pregnant and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding, severe nausea/vomiting, or if your uterus seems to be growing too quickly, consult your doctor or obstetrician immediately. Diagnosis is often made by ultrasound (showing characteristic 'snowstorm' appearance for complete mole, or abnormal fetus/placenta for partial mole) and very high hCG levels.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "A molar pregnancy cannot result in a live birth and requires prompt medical treatment to remove the abnormal tissue from the uterus, usually by suction dilation and curettage (D&C).",
      "Close follow-up care after removal is crucial to monitor hCG levels until they return to normal (non-pregnant levels). This is because some molar tissue can sometimes persist and develop into a rare form of cancer called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which is highly treatable if detected early. hCG monitoring may continue for 6 months to a year or more.",
      "It's very important to avoid getting pregnant again until hCG levels have been normal for the recommended period and your doctor gives clearance. Reliable contraception is necessary during this time.",

This could indicate a more serious condition like testicular torsion (a surgical emergency), epididymitis, or a strangulated inguinal hernia, which can sometimes present with scrotal swelling.",
    "general_advice": "A hydrocele is a collection of fluid in the sac that surrounds a testicle (tunica vaginalis), causing swelling in the scrotum. It's common in newborn male infants and often resolves on its own within the first year of life. In newborns, it's usually a 'communicating' hydrocele, meaning there's an open connection between the abdomen and the scrotum that allows peritoneal fluid to drain into the scrotum (this connection normally closes). In older boys and adult men, hydroceles can develop due to inflammation or injury to the testicle or epididymis, or sometimes for no apparent reason ('non-communicating' hydrocele, where the sac around the testicle produces too much fluid or doesn't absorb it properly). A hydrocele usually presents as a painless, soft swelling of one or both sides of the scrotum. The scrotum may feel like a water-filled balloon. It can sometimes cause a feeling of heaviness or mild discomfort if large. Hydroceles are generally not dangerous and do not affect fertility.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops scrotal swelling, see a doctor (pediatrician, urologist, or primary care) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of scrotal swelling (like inguinal hernia, varicocele, testicular tumor, or infection). Diagnosis is often made by physical exam (the swelling may transilluminate - light shines through it) and sometimes ultrasound.",

      "If a hydrocele is large, causing discomfort, heaviness, or cosmetic concern, treatment options include:",
      "  - Surgical repair (hydrocelectomy): This is the most common and effective treatment. The sac containing the fluid is surgically removed or altered to prevent fluid re-accumulation.",
      "  - Needle aspiration: Draining the fluid with a needle. This is less invasive but hydroceles often recur after aspiration alone. Sclerotherapy (injecting a sclerosing agent after aspiration to try and prevent recurrence) is sometimes done but has a higher complication rate and is less commonly used than surgery.",

Untreated or acutely worsening hydrocephalus can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles (fluid-filled cavities) of the brain. CSF normally circulates through the ventricles and around the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning and nutrients. Hydrocephalus occurs when there is an imbalance between CSF production and absorption, or a blockage in its flow, leading to an increase in CSF volume and pressure within the skull. This can cause the ventricles to enlarge and put pressure on brain tissue, potentially leading to brain damage. Hydrocephalus can be: 1) Congenital: Present at birth, often due to genetic abnormalities or developmental problems (e.g., aqueductal stenosis, spina bifida, Dandy-Walker syndrome). 2) Acquired: Develops after birth due to conditions like head injury, brain tumor, stroke, meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or complications of prematurity. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) is a type that typically affects older adults, with enlarged ventricles but often normal or intermittently elevated CSF pressure. Symptoms vary with age and severity. In infants: rapid increase in head circumference, bulging fontanelle, vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, downward deviation of eyes ('sunsetting'). In older children/adults: headache, nausea/vomiting, vision problems, balance/coordination difficulties, gait disturbance, cognitive decline (memory problems, confusion), urinary incontinence, lethargy, personality changes.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops symptoms suggestive of hydrocephalus, consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist, or neurosurgeon) immediately. Diagnosis involves a neurological exam and brain imaging (ultrasound for infants, CT or MRI for older children/adults). Sometimes intracranial pressure monitoring or CSF flow studies are done.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Hydrocephalus almost always requires surgical treatment to manage CSF flow and reduce pressure.",

A shunt is a surgically implanted tube system that diverts excess CSF from the brain ventricles to another part of the body where it can be absorbed (usually the abdomen - ventriculoperitoneal/VP shunt, or sometimes the heart or pleural space). Shunts have a valve to regulate flow and pressure.",

Bilateral hydronephrosis or hydronephrosis in a solitary kidney causing acute obstruction can rapidly lead to kidney damage.",
    "general_advice": "Hydronephrosis is the swelling or distension of one or both kidneys due to a buildup of urine. It occurs when there is a blockage or obstruction in the urinary tract that prevents urine from draining normally from the kidney(s) down to the bladder and out of the body. This backup of urine causes pressure to build in the kidney, which can lead to enlargement of the renal pelvis and calyces (the urine-collecting structures within the kidney) and, if prolonged or severe, can damage kidney tissue and impair kidney function. Causes of obstruction can occur at any level of the urinary tract: 1) Ureter: Kidney stones, tumors, blood clots, strictures (narrowing), congenital abnormalities (e.g., ureteropelvic junction - UPJ obstruction). 2) Bladder: Bladder stones, tumors, neurogenic bladder (impaired bladder function), bladder outlet obstruction. 3) Urethra: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men, urethral strictures, tumors. Pregnancy can also cause physiological hydronephrosis due to hormonal changes and pressure from the enlarging uterus. Symptoms depend on whether the obstruction is acute or chronic, unilateral or bilateral, and the underlying cause. Acute obstruction often causes severe flank pain (renal colic). Chronic hydronephrosis may be asymptomatic or cause dull flank pain, changes in urination (frequency, urgency, decreased output), nausea, vomiting, fever (if infection is present), or blood in the urine.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms suggestive of hydronephrosis or urinary obstruction, consult your doctor (primary care, urologist, or nephrologist).

This is the most frequent cause in outpatients. 2) Cancer (malignancy): Certain cancers can cause hypercalcemia, either by spreading to bones and causing calcium release, or by producing substances that raise calcium levels (e.g., parathyroid hormone-related protein - PTHrP). This is a common cause in hospitalized patients. Other causes include: certain medications (e.g., thiazide diuretics, lithium, excessive vitamin D or calcium supplements), prolonged immobilization, kidney disease, certain granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, tuberculosis), adrenal insufficiency, or rare genetic conditions.

However, too much cholesterol, particularly LDL (low-density lipoprotein, often called 'bad' cholesterol), can lead to atherosclerosis, where plaques build up in the arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This increases the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. High cholesterol usually causes no symptoms itself, which is why regular screening is important. Causes can include: diet high in saturated and trans fats, lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking, genetics (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia - an inherited condition causing very high cholesterol from a young age), older age, and underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney disease).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Regular cholesterol screening (lipid panel blood test) is recommended for adults (starting in young adulthood, or earlier if risk factors are present) as per guidelines. If your cholesterol levels are high, your doctor will discuss a management plan based on your overall cardiovascular risk profile.",

HG can be a serious condition requiring hospitalization.",
    "general_advice": "Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, far more intense and persistent than typical 'morning sickness.' It can lead to significant weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, ketosis (buildup of ketones due to fat breakdown for energy), and malnutrition if not managed effectively. The exact cause is unknown but is thought to be related to rapidly rising hormone levels (especially hCG and estrogen), though psychological and genetic factors may also play a role. HG usually begins in the first trimester (often by 5-6 weeks) and may persist throughout much of the pregnancy for some women, though it often improves by mid-pregnancy (around 20 weeks). Symptoms include: severe, persistent nausea and vomiting (often multiple times a day), inability to keep food or fluids down, significant weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, fatigue, and sometimes dizziness or lightheadedness. HG can significantly impact a woman's physical and emotional well-being and ability to function.",

    "general_advice": "Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive sweating that is not necessarily related to heat or exercise. The sweating can be so profuse that it soaks through clothing, drips from hands, or causes skin problems and social embarrassment. There are two main types: 1) Primary focal hyperhidrosis: The most common type, where excessive sweating occurs in specific areas (focal points) like the armpits (axillary hyperhidrosis), palms of the hands (palmar hyperhidrosis), soles of the feet (plantar hyperhidrosis), or face/scalp (craniofacial hyperhidrosis). It usually starts in childhood or adolescence, is often bilateral and symmetrical, and tends to stop during sleep. The cause is thought to be overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system controlling sweat glands; there's often a family history. 2) Secondary generalized hyperhidrosis: Excessive sweating that affects the entire body or larger areas, and is caused by an underlying medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, diabetes, menopause, infections, certain cancers like lymphoma, neurological disorders) or as a side effect of certain medications (e.g., some antidepressants, opioids, hormonal drugs). This type can occur at any age and may also occur during sleep.",

Even if asymptomatic, a very high potassium level found on a blood test requires urgent management.",
    "general_advice": "Hyperkalemia is a condition where the level of potassium in your blood is higher than normal. Potassium is an essential electrolyte that plays a critical role in nerve function, muscle contraction (including the heart muscle), and fluid balance. The kidneys are primarily responsible for excreting excess potassium. Causes of hyperkalemia include: 1) Impaired kidney function (acute or chronic kidney disease - most common cause, as kidneys can't remove potassium effectively). 2) Medications that affect potassium levels or kidney function (e.g., ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone, NSAIDs, beta-blockers, trimethoprim). 3) Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease - lack of aldosterone, which helps excrete potassium). 4) Excessive potassium intake (usually only a problem if kidney function is also impaired - from diet, salt substitutes containing potassium chloride, or potassium supplements). 5) Conditions causing potassium to shift out of cells into the bloodstream (e.g., tissue damage from burns or crush injuries, rhabdomyolysis, diabetic ketoacidosis, metabolic acidosis). 6) Pseudohyperkalemia (falsely elevated reading due to issues with blood draw or sample handling). Mild hyperkalemia may cause no symptoms. As levels rise, symptoms can occur (see emergency advice).",

    "general_advice": "Hypernatremia is an electrolyte imbalance characterized by an elevated sodium level in the blood. It usually results from a net water loss or, less commonly, a net sodium gain, leading to a relative deficit of water compared to sodium in the body. This causes body fluids to become too concentrated. The body normally regulates sodium and water balance through thirst and the kidneys' ability to concentrate or dilute urine (via antidiuretic hormone - ADH). Common causes include: 1) Inadequate water intake: Often in individuals who cannot express thirst or access water (e.g., infants, elderly, debilitated, impaired mental status). 2) Excessive water loss: From profuse sweating (e.g., during exercise in heat without adequate rehydration), severe diarrhea or vomiting, fever, burns, or conditions like diabetes insipidus (lack of ADH or kidney unresponsiveness to ADH, leading to excretion of large volumes of dilute urine). 3) Excessive sodium intake or retention (less common): e.g., administration of hypertonic saline solutions, salt poisoning (rare), primary hyperaldosteronism. Symptoms depend on the severity and rapidity of onset. Mild hypernatremia may cause thirst, dry mouth, restlessness, or irritability. As it worsens, symptoms can include lethargy, weakness, confusion, muscle twitching or spasticity, seizures, and coma.",

    "general_advice": "Hyperopia, commonly known as farsightedness or long-sightedness, is a refractive error where distant objects are usually seen clearly, but close-up objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is too short from front to back, or the cornea (clear front surface of the eye) or lens has too little curvature. This causes light entering the eye to focus behind the retina, instead of directly on it. Young people with mild to moderate hyperopia may not notice vision problems because their eyes' natural lenses can accommodate (change shape) to bring near objects into focus. However, this constant accommodative effort can lead to symptoms like eye strain, headaches (especially after close work like reading or computer use), fatigue, squinting, or difficulty concentrating on near tasks. As people age, the ability to accommodate decreases, and near vision problems become more apparent. Severe hyperopia can cause blurry vision at all distances. It can also be associated with an increased risk of certain eye conditions like accommodative esotropia (inward turning of eye in children) or angle-closure glaucoma (in adults).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child experiences blurry near vision, eye strain, headaches after close work, or other symptoms suggestive of hyperopia, schedule a comprehensive eye examination with an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience: fainting (syncope) or near-fainting, especially during or after physical exertion; severe chest pain; significant shortness of breath; or a very rapid or irregular heartbeat causing severe symptoms. HOCM can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young athletes, though this is rare. Any new or worsening symptoms warrant urgent evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), often just called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as obstruction is not always present, is a genetic heart condition where the heart muscle (myocardium), particularly of the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) and sometimes the septum (wall between ventricles), becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). This thickening can make it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively and can also stiffen the ventricle, impairing its ability to relax and fill with blood. In HOCM, the thickened septum can obstruct or block blood flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta, especially during exertion. HCM can also affect the mitral valve and lead to arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Symptoms can vary widely, from none to severe, and may include: shortness of breath (especially with exertion), chest pain or pressure (angina), fatigue, dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting (syncope), palpitations (sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeat), and swelling in ankles/feet/legs. Many individuals are undiagnosed. It's a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people, including athletes.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a family history of HCM or sudden cardiac death, or if you experience symptoms suggestive of HCM, consult a doctor (cardiologist, often one specializing in cardiomyopathies).

    "general_advice": "Hypocalcemia is a condition where the level of calcium in your blood is lower than normal. Calcium is essential for nerve function, muscle contraction, blood clotting, and bone health. The body tightly regulates calcium levels, primarily through parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. Causes of hypocalcemia include: 1) Hypoparathyroidism: Underactivity of the parathyroid glands (e.g., after neck surgery damaging parathyroids, autoimmune, genetic). PTH normally raises blood calcium. 2) Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption from the gut. 3) Chronic kidney disease: Kidneys are involved in activating vitamin D and regulating calcium/phosphate. 4) Magnesium deficiency: Low magnesium can impair PTH secretion and action. 5) Certain medications: e.g., bisphosphonates, cinacalcet, some diuretics, phosphate-containing laxatives/enemas. 6) Pancreatitis (acute): Calcium can be deposited in inflamed pancreatic tissue. 7) Massive blood transfusions (citrate in transfused blood can bind calcium). 8) Sepsis or critical illness. Mild hypocalcemia may be asymptomatic. As levels fall, symptoms can include: numbness or tingling in fingers, toes, and around the mouth (perioral paresthesia); muscle cramps or spasms (tetany); muscle weakness or twitching; fatigue; irritability; depression; anxiety; dry skin/brittle nails; and in severe cases, seizures, arrhythmias, or laryngospasm.",

Hyponatremia usually results from an excess of water in the body relative to sodium (dilutional hyponatremia), rather than a true sodium deficiency, though sodium loss can also contribute. Causes can be complex and include: 1) Excessive fluid intake (especially plain water, e.g., psychogenic polydipsia, or during prolonged endurance exercise without adequate electrolyte replacement). 2) Conditions causing impaired water excretion by kidneys: Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH - too much ADH causes water retention), heart failure, liver cirrhosis, kidney disease, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol deficiency). 3) Excessive sodium loss: From severe vomiting or diarrhea, profuse sweating (with water-only replacement), use of diuretic medications (especially thiazides), certain kidney diseases (salt-wasting nephropathies). 4) Certain medications (e.g., some antidepressants like SSRIs, carbamazepine, ecstasy). Mild, chronic hyponatremia may be asymptomatic or cause subtle symptoms like fatigue or mild cognitive impairment. As sodium levels fall or drop rapidly, symptoms become more severe (see emergency advice).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Hyponatremia is diagnosed with a blood test (serum sodium level).

    "general_advice": "Hypothyroidism is a common condition where the thyroid gland (located in the neck) does not produce enough thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) to meet the body's needs. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, affecting virtually every organ system. When thyroid hormone levels are low, the body's processes slow down. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas with sufficient iodine is Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland - see separate entry). Other causes include: treatment for hyperthyroidism (e.g., radioactive iodine therapy, thyroid surgery), certain medications (e.g., lithium, amiodarone), radiation therapy to the neck or head, pituitary gland disorders (secondary hypothyroidism - pituitary doesn't produce enough TSH to stimulate thyroid), congenital hypothyroidism (present at birth), and iodine deficiency (rare in developed countries). Symptoms often develop gradually and can be vague, including: fatigue, lethargy, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, unexplained weight gain (or difficulty losing weight), dry skin, hair loss or thinning/brittle hair, puffy face, hoarse voice, muscle aches/weakness/stiffness, joint pain/stiffness, heavy or irregular menstrual periods, depression, impaired memory or concentration ('brain fog'), slowed heart rate, and goiter (enlarged thyroid - can occur in some types).",

    "general_advice": "Idiopathic dysmenorrhea, more commonly known as primary dysmenorrhea, refers to painful menstrual periods (cramps) that occur in the absence of any identifiable underlying pelvic pathology (like endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, or PID). It's very common, especially in adolescents and young women. The pain is thought to be caused by excessive production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that cause uterine muscle contractions to help shed the uterine lining during menstruation. High levels of prostaglandins can cause strong, painful cramps. The pain typically begins just before or with the onset of menstrual bleeding and lasts for 1-3 days. It's often described as cramping or colicky pain in the lower abdomen, which may radiate to the lower back or thighs. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, or dizziness can sometimes accompany the pain.",

If untreated, ileus can lead to complications like bowel ischemia or perforation (rare).",
    "general_advice": "Ileus, often called paralytic ileus or adynamic ileus, is a condition in which there is a lack of normal intestinal motility (peristalsis - the coordinated muscle contractions that move contents through the digestive tract), leading to a functional obstruction of the bowel, without any actual physical blockage. This means food, fluid, and gas cannot pass through the intestines properly. Common causes include: 1) Abdominal surgery (postoperative ileus is very common and usually temporary). 2) Medications (e.g., opioids, anticholinergics, some anesthetics). 3) Infections or inflammation within the abdomen (e.g., peritonitis, pancreatitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, sepsis). 4) Electrolyte imbalances (especially low potassium - hypokalemia, or low magnesium). 5) Severe illness or trauma. 6) Intestinal ischemia (reduced blood flow to the intestines). 7) Spinal cord injury or certain neurological conditions. Symptoms include: abdominal bloating or distension, abdominal pain (can be diffuse and crampy, or sometimes absent if bowel is completely atonic), nausea, vomiting (may contain bile or fecal matter if prolonged), inability to pass stool or gas (obstipation), and absent or diminished bowel sounds on examination.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop symptoms of ileus, especially after surgery or if you have risk factors, consult your doctor or go to an emergency department.

    "general_advice": "Impetigo is a common and highly contagious bacterial skin infection that primarily affects infants and young children, but can occur at any age. It's usually caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* (staph) or *Streptococcus pyogenes* (strep) bacteria. There are two main types: 1) Non-bullous impetigo (most common): Starts as small red sores or blisters that quickly rupture, ooze fluid, and then form a characteristic honey-colored or yellowish-brown crust. Often occurs around the nose and mouth, but can appear anywhere on the body. Usually itchy but not painful. 2) Bullous impetigo: Less common, characterized by larger, fluid-filled blisters (bullae) that appear on the trunk, arms, or legs. The blisters are fragile and may rupture, leaving a moist, red base, then a thin, varnish-like crust. This form is almost always caused by staph bacteria that produce a toxin. Impetigo spreads easily through direct contact with sores or contaminated items (towels, clothing, toys).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect impetigo, see a doctor. Diagnosis is usually based on the appearance of the lesions.

Mifepristone blocks progesterone (needed for pregnancy to continue), and misoprostol causes uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. It's similar to an early miscarriage. 2) Surgical abortion: Different procedures are used depending on gestational age. Vacuum aspiration (suction curettage) is common in the first trimester. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) is typically used in the second trimester. These procedures are performed by trained healthcare providers in a clinical setting.

    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most cases of viral gastroenteritis are self-limiting and resolve with home care. However, see a doctor if symptoms are severe, if dehydration is suspected, if there's bloody diarrhea, high fever, or if symptoms persist for more than a few days, or if you are in a high-risk group. A doctor can help determine if it's viral or bacterial/parasitic (stool tests may be done) and whether specific treatment (like antibiotics for some bacterial infections) is needed. Antibiotics are not effective for viral gastroenteritis.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Prevent dehydration: This is the most important step. Drink plenty of clear fluids (water, oral rehydration solution - ORS like Pedialyte, diluted juice, clear broths, flat ginger ale). Sip frequently, especially after episodes of vomiting or diarrhea. Avoid sugary drinks (can worsen diarrhea), caffeine, and alcohol.",
      "Rest as much as possible.",
      "Gradual reintroduction of food: Once vomiting subsides, start with bland, easily digestible foods (BRAT diet - Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast; also crackers, plain potatoes, boiled chicken). Avoid fatty, spicy, or dairy foods initially.",
      "Over-the-counter medications: Antidiarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide - Imodium) may be used by adults for watery diarrhea if no fever or blood in stool, but use with caution and discuss with doctor first, as they can sometimes prolong bacterial infections. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) may help with nausea and diarrhea. Antiemetics for nausea (prescription or OTC like dimenhydrinate) may be used cautiously.",
      "Prevention of spread: Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, especially after using the toilet or changing diapers, and before preparing/eating food. Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces. Avoid preparing food for others if you are sick. Stay home from work/school until symptoms resolve."

    "emergency_advice": "Seek medical attention if an ingrown toenail shows signs of significant infection (spreading redness, warmth, significant swelling, pus, fever), if pain is severe and uncontrolled, or if you have diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, or poor circulation in your feet, as these conditions increase the risk of serious complications like ulcers or gangrene from an infected ingrown toenail.",
    "general_advice": "An ingrown toenail (onychocryptosis) occurs when the corner or side of a toenail, usually on the big toe, grows into the soft flesh of the toe. This can cause pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes infection in the surrounding skin. Common causes include: cutting toenails too short or rounding the edges (nails should be cut straight across), wearing shoes that are too tight or narrow and crowd the toes, injury to the toenail (e.g., stubbing the toe), unusually curved toenails (pincer nails), or poor foot hygiene. If an infection develops, there may be pus drainage and increased pain/swelling.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If home care doesn't relieve symptoms within a few days, if pain is severe, or if there are signs of infection, consult a doctor or podiatrist. They can assess the ingrown toenail and may perform a minor procedure to lift or partially/fully remove the ingrown portion of the nail, often with local anesthesia. Antibiotics may be prescribed if infected.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "For mild ingrown toenails without significant infection:",
      "  - Soak the foot in warm water for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day, to soften the skin and reduce swelling. Adding Epsom salts or mild soap can be helpful.",
      "  - After soaking, gently try to lift the corner of the ingrown nail out from the skin with a clean instrument (e.g., a dental floss threader or a small piece of cotton wisped under the edge). This may need to be done repeatedly.",
      "  - Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment to the area and cover with a bandage.",
      "  - Wear comfortable, open-toed or wide-toed shoes to avoid pressure on the toe.",
      "  - Take over-the-counter pain relievers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) if needed.",

    "severity_level": "Medium",
    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate emergency medical attention if an inguinal hernia becomes incarcerated (trapped and cannot be pushed back in) or strangulated (blood supply to the trapped tissue is cut off). Signs include: sudden, severe pain in the hernia bulge that rapidly worsens; bulge becomes firm, tender, and cannot be reduced; nausea, vomiting; fever; inability to pass gas or have a bowel movement; or redness/discoloration over the bulge. Strangulation is a life-threatening emergency requiring urgent surgery.",
    "general_advice": "An inguinal hernia occurs when soft tissue, usually part of the intestine or fatty tissue, protrudes through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall muscles, into the inguinal canal in the groin area. In men, the inguinal canal is where the spermatic cord passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. Inguinal hernias are much more common in men than women. They can be present at birth (indirect inguinal hernia, due to a persistent opening in the abdominal wall) or develop later in life (direct inguinal hernia, due to weakening of abdominal muscles with age or strain). Symptoms include a visible bulge or lump in the groin or scrotum, which may become more noticeable when standing, coughing, or straining, and may disappear when lying down. There may be aching, pain, discomfort, pressure, or a heavy sensation in the groin, especially with activity. Some inguinal hernias cause no symptoms.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a bulge or lump in your groin, or experience groin pain or discomfort, consult your doctor. They can usually diagnose an inguinal hernia with a physical exam. While small, asymptomatic hernias may sometimes be monitored, surgical repair (herniorrhaphy, often done laparoscopically or open) is usually recommended to prevent complications like incarceration or strangulation, especially if the hernia is symptomatic or enlarging.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If you have an inguinal hernia that is not yet repaired:",
      "  - Avoid heavy lifting and straining, which can worsen the hernia or increase risk of complications.",
      "  - Maintain a healthy weight to reduce pressure on the abdominal wall.",
      "  - Eat a high-fiber diet and drink plenty of fluids to prevent constipation and straining during bowel movements.",
      "  - Use proper lifting techniques.",
      "  - A hernia truss or binder is generally not recommended as a long-term solution and does not cure the hernia, though some may use it temporarily for support under medical advice.",
      "If the hernia bulge can be gently pushed back in (reducible), do so when lying down if it becomes prominent.",
      "Be aware of the signs of incarceration/strangulation and seek emergency care if they occur.",

Go to an urgent care or emergency room.",
    "general_advice": "Ankle injury is a broad term for damage to the bones, ligaments, tendons, or muscles around the ankle joint. Common ankle injuries include: 1) Ankle sprain: Stretching or tearing of ligaments (fibrous bands connecting bones), most commonly affecting the ligaments on the outside of the ankle due to an inversion injury (foot rolls inward). Sprains are graded by severity (Grade I - mild stretch, II - partial tear, III - complete tear). 2) Ankle strain: Stretching or tearing of muscles or tendons around the ankle. 3) Ankle fracture: Break in one or more ankle bones (see separate entry). Symptoms vary depending on the type and severity of injury but often include pain, swelling, bruising, tenderness, instability, and difficulty moving or bearing weight on the ankle.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If an ankle injury is more than mild (e.g., significant pain, swelling, inability to bear weight, or if symptoms don't improve with home care after a few days), see a doctor (primary care, sports medicine, or orthopedist).
