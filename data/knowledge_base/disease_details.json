These can indicate a critical valve problem or complication.",
    "general_advice": "Aortic valve disease occurs when the aortic valve, located between the left ventricle (the heart's main pumping chamber) and the aorta (the body's main artery), doesn't work properly. The two main types are: 1) Aortic stenosis: The valve cusps become stiff and narrowed, making it harder for the heart to pump blood out to the body. 2) Aortic regurgitation (or insufficiency): The valve doesn't close tightly, allowing some blood to leak backward into the left ventricle. Causes can include congenital defects, age-related calcification, rheumatic fever, infections (endocarditis), or connective tissue disorders. Symptoms may not appear until the condition is advanced and can include chest pain (angina), fatigue, shortness of breath (especially with exertion or when lying down), dizziness or fainting, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), and swollen ankles/feet.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience any symptoms suggestive of aortic valve disease, see a doctor (often a cardiologist). If a heart murmur is detected during a routine exam, further investigation (like an echocardiogram) is usually needed. Early diagnosis and monitoring are important.

This could indicate a complication like retinal detachment or severe inflammation.",
    "general_advice": "Aphakia is the absence of the lens of the eye. The lens is the clear structure behind the iris that focuses light onto the retina. Aphakia most commonly occurs after surgical removal of a cataract (a clouded lens) when an intraocular lens (IOL) implant is not placed, or if an IOL is removed due to complications. It can also result from eye trauma or, rarely, be a congenital condition. Without a lens, the eye is extremely farsighted (hyperopic) and has very poor, blurry vision. There is also a loss of accommodation (the ability to focus on near objects).",

Chronic urinary retention can lead to serious kidney damage.",
    "general_advice": "Atonic bladder (also known as flaccid or neurogenic bladder) is a condition where the bladder muscle (detrusor muscle) loses its ability to contract effectively, leading to an inability to empty the bladder completely or at all (urinary retention). This results in the bladder becoming overstretched and distended. It's usually caused by damage to the nerves that control bladder function. Common causes include spinal cord injuries, nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, pelvic surgery, or certain medications. Symptoms include difficulty starting urination, a weak or interrupted urine stream, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, frequent urination of small amounts, overflow incontinence (leaking urine when the bladder is too full), and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).",

Some AFib episodes can be life-threatening or lead to serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib or AF) is the most common type of sustained cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). It occurs when the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly, out of coordination with the lower chambers (the ventricles). This can lead to a rapid and irregular pulse. AFib can cause palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest discomfort, though some people have no symptoms. Major risks associated with AFib are stroke (due to blood clots forming in the atria) and heart failure. Risk factors include older age, high blood pressure, underlying heart disease (coronary artery disease, valve disease, heart failure), obesity, diabetes, thyroid disease, excessive alcohol intake, and sleep apnea.",

Like AFib, atrial flutter can lead to serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Atrial flutter is another type of abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that originates in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). Unlike the chaotic rhythm of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter is characterized by a rapid but regular (or sometimes regularly irregular) atrial rhythm, often around 250-350 beats per minute. Not all of these fast atrial beats conduct to the ventricles (lower chambers), so the ventricular rate (pulse) is usually slower but can still be quite fast and regular (e.g., 150 bpm if there's 2:1 conduction). Symptoms can include palpitations (often described as a rapid, regular fluttering), fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest discomfort. Atrial flutter shares many risk factors with AFib (e.g., heart disease, lung disease, previous heart surgery) and also carries an increased risk of stroke.",

Most simple cysts are discovered incidentally during imaging tests (like ultrasound, CT, or MRI) done for other reasons. They are different from cysts associated with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which is a more serious genetic disorder.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most simple kidney cysts do not require treatment. If a cyst is found, your doctor will evaluate its characteristics (e.g., size, appearance on imaging) to confirm it's a simple cyst and not something more complex or suspicious. Follow-up imaging may be recommended periodically to monitor for any changes, especially for larger cysts. If a cyst causes symptoms (e.g., pain, blockage of urine flow, high blood pressure - though this is uncommon for simple cysts), treatment (like drainage or surgical removal) might be considered.",

    "general_advice": "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo, which is a sudden sensation that you or your surroundings are spinning or whirling. BPPV occurs when tiny calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia or 'canaliths'), normally located in a part of the inner ear called the utricle, become dislodged and migrate into one of the semicircular canals (fluid-filled tubes in the inner ear that sense head rotation). This makes the canal sensitive to head position changes it would normally not respond to. Episodes of vertigo are brief (usually less than a minute), intense, and are triggered by specific changes in head position, such as rolling over in bed, looking up, or bending over.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience recurrent episodes of vertigo, especially triggered by head movements, see a doctor (primary care, neurologist, or ENT specialist). They can diagnose BPPV (often with specific positional tests like the Dix-Hallpike maneuver) and differentiate it from other causes of dizziness. Treatment often involves canalith repositioning procedures (like the Epley maneuver or Semont maneuver) performed by a trained professional, which can be very effective.",

    "general_advice": "Brachial neuritis, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome or neuralgic amyotrophy, is a rare disorder characterized by the sudden onset of severe pain, usually in the shoulder and upper arm, followed by muscle weakness, paralysis, and atrophy (wasting) in the affected arm, shoulder, and sometimes hand. It affects the brachial plexus, a network of nerves that extends from the spinal cord in the neck through the shoulder and into the arm. The exact cause is unknown, but it's thought to be an immune-mediated inflammatory response, often triggered by a recent infection, vaccination, surgery, or injury, though it can also occur spontaneously. Sensory changes (numbness, tingling) can also occur. Recovery can be slow, often taking months to years, and may not always be complete.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop sudden, severe shoulder/arm pain followed by weakness, consult a doctor (neurologist).

They can feel like soft grapes or water-filled balloons, or sometimes they can be firm. Cysts can vary in size and may become tender or painful, especially before a menstrual period due to hormonal changes. Simple cysts are fluid-filled with smooth, thin walls and do not increase breast cancer risk. Complex or complicated cysts have some internal debris or thicker walls and may require further evaluation to rule out other conditions.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you discover any new breast lump or change, including what you suspect might be a cyst, always see a doctor for evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out cancer. Diagnosis is often made with ultrasound, which can distinguish a fluid-filled cyst from a solid mass. A mammogram may also be done. If a cyst is large, painful, or if there's any uncertainty, a fine-needle aspiration (draining the fluid with a needle) may be performed, which can both diagnose and treat the cyst (by relieving pressure).",

    "general_advice": "Cardiomyopathy is a general term for diseases of the heart muscle (myocardium) that make it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively to the rest of the body. It can lead to heart failure. There are several types of cardiomyopathy, including: 1) Dilated cardiomyopathy: The heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle) becomes enlarged (dilated) and weakened. 2) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. 3) Restrictive cardiomyopathy: The heart muscle becomes stiff and less elastic, impairing its ability to fill with blood. 4) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD): Muscle tissue in the right ventricle is replaced by scar tissue and fat, leading to arrhythmias. Causes can be genetic/inherited, or acquired due to conditions like long-term high blood pressure, heart attacks, viral infections, alcohol abuse, certain drugs, or unknown (idiopathic). Symptoms can include shortness of breath (with exertion or at rest), fatigue, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet (edema), irregular heartbeat or palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.",

    "general_advice": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition that causes pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and arm. It occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the palm of the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed (compressed) at the wrist within a narrow passageway called the carpal tunnel. The median nerve controls sensation to the palm side of the thumb and fingers (except the little finger), as well as some small muscles in the hand. Repetitive hand and wrist motions, prolonged wrist flexion or extension, wrist injuries, and certain medical conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, thyroid disorders, pregnancy, obesity) can contribute to swelling and pressure within the carpal tunnel. Symptoms often start gradually and may be worse at night or when performing certain activities.",

    "general_advice": "A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. The lens is located behind the iris and pupil and works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina at the back of the eye to produce clear vision. When a cataract forms, it's like looking through a foggy or dusty window. Most cataracts develop slowly as part of the aging process (age-related cataracts are very common). Other causes include eye injuries, certain medications (like long-term steroid use), diabetes, excessive sun exposure, smoking, and genetic factors. Symptoms include blurry, cloudy, or dim vision; increased difficulty with vision at night; sensitivity to light and glare; seeing 'halos' around lights; frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription; fading or yellowing of colors; and double vision in a single eye.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice changes in your vision or suspect you have cataracts, schedule an eye examination with an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

    "general_advice": "Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When a person with celiac disease consumes gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the lining of the small intestine (specifically the villi, which are tiny finger-like projections responsible for nutrient absorption). This damage interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food, leading to malnutrition and a range of symptoms. Symptoms can vary widely and affect multiple systems. Digestive symptoms may include diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, nausea, and vomiting. Non-digestive symptoms can include fatigue, anemia (iron deficiency), bone or joint pain, osteoporosis, skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), mouth ulcers, headaches, depression, anxiety, and neurological issues (numbness/tingling, balance problems). Some people may have no obvious symptoms.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you or your child has celiac disease based on symptoms or risk factors (e.g., family history, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease), consult a doctor (primary care or gastroenterologist). Diagnosis involves blood tests (to check for specific antibodies like tTG-IgA) and usually an endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine to confirm damage to the villi. It's important to continue eating gluten until testing is complete, as a gluten-free diet can affect test results.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. This means avoiding all foods and products containing wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. Oats may be tolerated if certified gluten-free (to avoid cross-contamination).",

    "general_advice": "Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix, the lower, narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina. It can be caused by various factors, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, or genital herpes. Non-infectious causes can include allergic reactions (e.g., to spermicides, latex in condoms, or feminine hygiene products), irritation from foreign objects (like diaphragms or cervical caps), or bacterial vaginosis. Often, cervicitis causes no symptoms, but when symptoms occur, they may include: abnormal vaginal discharge (may be grayish, yellowish, or have an odor), bleeding between periods or after intercourse, pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), vaginal itching or irritation, and frequent or painful urination.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience any symptoms of cervicitis, or if you've been exposed to an STI, see a doctor or gynecologist. Diagnosis involves a pelvic exam, and samples of cervical discharge may be taken to test for infections. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If an STI is identified, antibiotics or antiviral medications will be prescribed. Your sexual partner(s) will also need to be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread.",

    "general_advice": "A chalazion is a small, usually painless, firm lump or swelling that appears in the upper or lower eyelid. It's caused by a blockage and inflammation of a Meibomian gland, which are small oil glands located along the edge of the eyelids that produce the oily part of tears. When a gland becomes blocked, the oil builds up and causes the gland to swell, forming a chalazion. It can sometimes become red, swollen, and tender if it gets inflamed or infected (internal hordeolum or stye), but often it's a non-tender, slowly enlarging lump. It's different from an external stye (hordeolum), which is an infection of an eyelash follicle and is usually more painful and closer to the eyelid margin.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a chalazion is persistent, very large, affects vision, or if you are unsure of the diagnosis, consult an eye doctor. They can confirm it's a chalazion and may recommend treatment if it's bothersome or not resolving. In rare cases, a persistent chalazion might need to be biopsied to rule out other conditions.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Apply warm compresses to the affected eyelid for 10-15 minutes, 2-4 times a day. The warmth can help soften the hardened oil blocking the gland and promote drainage. Gently massage the eyelid afterwards (with clean hands) towards the lashes to help express the contents.",
      "Keep the eyelids clean. You can use a mild eyelid cleanser or diluted baby shampoo on a cotton swab to gently clean the base of the eyelashes.",
      "Avoid squeezing or trying to pop the chalazion, as this can worsen inflammation or spread infection.",
      "Do not wear eye makeup or contact lenses while you have an active chalazion or if it's inflamed.",
      "If a chalazion doesn't resolve with home care, an eye doctor may recommend a corticosteroid injection into the chalazion to reduce inflammation, or a minor surgical procedure (incision and curettage) to drain it."

Complications are more common in these groups.",
    "general_advice": "Chickenpox (varicella) is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It's characterized by an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) that appear all over the body. The rash typically starts as small red spots, which then develop into blisters that eventually crust over and heal. New spots can continue to appear for several days, so all three stages (spots, blisters, scabs) may be present at the same time. Other symptoms usually precede the rash by 1-2 days and include fever, headache, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Chickenpox is usually mild in healthy children but can be more severe in adolescents, adults, pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals. After a person has had chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate later in life to cause shingles (herpes zoster).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Consult a doctor if you suspect chickenpox, especially to confirm the diagnosis and discuss management, particularly for individuals at high risk of complications (see emergency advice).

    "general_advice": "Chlamydia is a very common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium *Chlamydia trachomatis*. It can infect both men and women and often has no symptoms, so many people are unaware they have it. If symptoms do occur, they may appear several weeks after infection. In women, symptoms can include abnormal vaginal discharge (may be yellowish or have an odor), burning sensation during urination, pain during intercourse, bleeding between periods or after sex, and lower abdominal pain. In men, symptoms can include discharge from the penis (may be watery or milky), burning sensation during urination, and pain or swelling in one or both testicles. Chlamydia can also infect the rectum (causing rectal pain, discharge, bleeding) or throat (usually asymptomatic). Untreated chlamydia can lead to serious long-term complications, including PID, infertility, ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis or reactive arthritis in men.",

Complications like gallbladder rupture or gangrene can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, a small organ located beneath the liver that stores and releases bile (a digestive fluid). It most commonly occurs when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile flows out of the gallbladder (this is called acute calculous cholecystitis). This blockage causes bile to build up, leading to inflammation, pressure, and pain. Less commonly, cholecystitis can occur without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis), often in critically ill patients. Symptoms typically include steady, severe pain in the upper right or central abdomen that may last for hours, pain that worsens with deep breaths, tenderness over the abdomen when touched, nausea, vomiting, and fever.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of cholecystitis, go to an emergency department or see your doctor immediately. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, blood tests (to check for signs of inflammation or infection, and liver function), and imaging tests (ultrasound is usually the first choice; HIDA scan, CT scan, or MRI may also be used).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "There are no direct self-care treatments for an acute cholecystitis attack; it requires medical management.",

      "Surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the definitive treatment and is often performed within a few days of admission, or sometimes later if the inflammation needs to settle first. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (minimally invasive) is the most common approach.",
      "To potentially reduce the risk of gallstones (a major cause of cholecystitis): maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet rich in fiber and healthy fats (avoiding very high-fat or greasy foods if they trigger symptoms), and exercise regularly.

These are serious conditions.",
    "general_advice": "Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of one or more gallstones in the common bile duct (CBD). The CBD is the tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine. Gallstones usually form in the gallbladder and can then pass into the CBD, or less commonly, they can form within the bile ducts themselves. When a stone obstructs the CBD, it can prevent bile from flowing properly, leading to symptoms and complications. Symptoms can include severe, episodic pain in the upper right or central abdomen (biliary colic, often lasting longer than with gallbladder stones alone), jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever or chills if infection (cholangitis) develops. It can also lead to pancreatitis if the stone blocks the opening where the bile duct and pancreatic duct join.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of choledocholithiasis, especially jaundice or severe pain, see a doctor or go to an emergency department promptly.

    "general_advice": "A cholesteatoma is an abnormal, non-cancerous skin growth (a cyst or sac filled with old skin cells) that can develop in the middle ear, behind the eardrum. It often starts due to recurrent ear infections or poor Eustachian tube function (the tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat). When the Eustachian tube doesn't work well, it can create negative pressure in the middle ear, pulling part of the eardrum inward and forming a pocket where skin cells can accumulate. Cholesteatomas can grow over time and damage the delicate bones of the middle ear (ossicles), leading to hearing loss. They can also cause chronic ear discharge (often foul-smelling), ear pain or pressure, dizziness, and rarely, more serious complications if they erode into the inner ear, facial nerve, or brain.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent ear discharge, hearing loss, ear pain, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in the ear, consult an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist. Diagnosis involves an ear exam (otoscopy), hearing tests (audiometry), and often a CT scan of the temporal bones to assess the extent of the cholesteatoma. Surgical removal is usually necessary.",

While CIDP is chronic, acute deteriorations can occur.",
    "general_advice": "Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive or relapsing-remitting weakness and impaired sensory function in the arms and legs. It's caused by damage to the myelin sheath (the protective covering of nerve fibers) of the peripheral nerves. This damage is thought to be due to an autoimmune response where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin. Symptoms typically develop gradually over two months or more (distinguishing it from Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which has a more acute onset) and can include: progressive muscle weakness (often symmetrical, affecting both proximal and distal muscles), numbness, tingling, or burning sensations (paresthesias), loss of reflexes, fatigue, and difficulty with balance and walking. It can affect people of any age but is more common in adults.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop progressive weakness, numbness, or tingling in your limbs, consult a doctor (neurologist). Diagnosis involves a neurological examination, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) – which typically show demyelination, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for elevated protein in cerebrospinal fluid, and sometimes nerve biopsy. Early diagnosis and treatment can help limit nerve damage and improve outcomes.",

    "general_advice": "Cold sores, also known as fever blisters or oral herpes, are small, painful, fluid-filled blisters that typically form on or around the lips, mouth, or nose. They are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and less commonly by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). After the initial infection, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate periodically, causing recurrent outbreaks. Outbreaks are often triggered by factors like stress, fatigue, illness (fever, cold), sun exposure, hormonal changes, or minor skin trauma to the area. Before the blisters appear, there may be a prodrome of tingling, itching, or burning at the site. The blisters then form, rupture, ooze, and eventually crust over and heal, usually within 7-14 days. Cold sores are contagious, especially when blisters are present, and can be spread through direct contact (kissing, sharing utensils or towels) or contact with the fluid from the blisters.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most cold sores don't require medical treatment. However, see a doctor if outbreaks are frequent or severe, or if you have concerns. A doctor can confirm the diagnosis and may prescribe antiviral medications (oral or topical, e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) to shorten the duration of an outbreak or, in some cases, for suppressive therapy to reduce recurrence frequency if started early in an outbreak or taken daily.",
    "self_care_tips": [

    "general_advice": "A colonic polyp (or colon polyp) is a small growth of tissue that forms on the lining of the colon (large intestine) or rectum. Polyps are common, especially as people age. Most polyps are benign (non-cancerous), but some types (particularly adenomatous polyps or adenomas) have the potential to develop into colorectal cancer over time if not removed. Other types include hyperplastic polyps (usually benign) and serrated polyps (can have increased cancer risk). Polyps often cause no symptoms and are usually found during colorectal cancer screening procedures like colonoscopy. When symptoms do occur, they may include rectal bleeding (bright red or dark blood in stool), changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea lasting more than a week), abdominal pain or cramping, or iron-deficiency anemia (from chronic blood loss). Risk factors for polyps include age over 50, family history of polyps or colorectal cancer, personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis), obesity, smoking, high-fat/low-fiber diet, and lack of exercise.",

    "general_advice": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by severe, persistent, burning pain, usually in an arm or leg, that is disproportionate to any initial injury (if an injury occurred). It often develops after an injury, surgery, stroke, or heart attack, but can also occur without a clear trigger. CRPS is thought to involve dysfunction in the central and/or peripheral nervous systems. Symptoms can include: intense burning or throbbing pain, swelling, changes in skin temperature (affected limb may feel warmer or cooler than the opposite limb), changes in skin color (blotchy, purple, pale, or red), changes in skin texture (shiny, thin, sweaty), changes in hair and nail growth, joint stiffness, muscle spasms or weakness, and limited range of motion in the affected limb. There are two types: CRPS-I (formerly Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy - RSD) occurs without confirmed nerve injury, and CRPS-II (formerly causalgia) occurs with confirmed nerve injury.",

These could indicate a more severe brain injury like a hematoma (bleed in the brain).",
    "general_advice": "A concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or by a hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, stretching and damaging brain cells and creating chemical changes in the brain. Concussions are common in contact sports but can also result from falls, car accidents, or any impact to the head. Symptoms can vary widely and may not appear immediately. They can include: headache or pressure in the head, dizziness or balance problems, nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to light or noise, blurred vision, feeling foggy or groggy, difficulty concentrating or remembering, confusion, drowsiness or fatigue, and emotional changes (irritability, sadness, anxiety). Loss of consciousness is not required for a concussion diagnosis.",

While conversion disorder is not life-threatening in itself, the symptoms can be disabling and it's crucial to exclude other serious medical causes.",
    "general_advice": "Conversion disorder, now officially termed Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD) in the DSM-5, is a mental health condition in which a person experiences physical and sensory problems, such as paralysis, numbness, blindness, deafness, or seizures, with no underlying neurological or medical cause that can explain them. The symptoms are real and not intentionally produced or feigned (as in factitious disorder or malingering). It's thought that the symptoms arise as a physical manifestation (conversion) of psychological distress, conflict, or trauma, though the person is often unaware of this connection. Symptoms can appear suddenly, often after a stressful event. The specific symptoms can vary widely and may affect motor function (e.g., weakness, paralysis, abnormal movements, tremors, difficulty walking, swallowing problems, speech impairment) or sensory function (e.g., numbness, blindness, deafness, loss of smell or touch).",

Respiratory distress can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a common respiratory infection in young children (typically ages 6 months to 3 years) that causes inflammation and swelling of the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe), leading to a narrowed airway. It's usually caused by a virus (most often parainfluenza virus). The hallmark symptoms are a distinctive barking cough (like a seal), hoarse voice, and stridor (a harsh, high-pitched sound when inhaling). Symptoms are often worse at night and may be preceded by cold-like symptoms (runny nose, fever) for a few days. Most cases are mild and can be managed at home.",

Do not attempt to move the person if there's a risk of further injury (e.g., spinal injury, unstable debris) unless they are in immediate danger. If a limb is crushed for a prolonged period, be aware of crush syndrome, which can occur after the limb is released and toxins are released into the bloodstream, potentially causing kidney failure and other life-threatening complications. Provide first aid for bleeding if safe to do so.",
    "general_advice": "A crushing injury occurs when a part of the body is subjected to high-pressure compressive forces, often between two heavy objects or when trapped under a heavy object. This can cause extensive damage to skin, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and bones. The severity depends on the amount of force, the duration of compression, and the body part involved. Complications can include severe bleeding, fractures, compartment syndrome (dangerous pressure buildup within muscle compartments), nerve damage, infection, rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue releasing harmful substances into the blood), and crush syndrome (systemic effects after prolonged compression, especially of large muscle masses).",

These fungi are found in the environment worldwide, often in soil contaminated with bird droppings (especially pigeon droppings for *C. neoformans*) or associated with certain trees (e.g., eucalyptus trees for *C. gattii*). Infection usually occurs by inhaling the fungal spores. In healthy individuals, cryptococcal infection is often asymptomatic or causes a mild, self-limiting lung infection. However, in people with weakened immune systems (e.g., those with HIV/AIDS - especially with low CD4 counts, organ transplant recipients, patients on long-term corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs), *Cryptococcus* can cause severe and life-threatening disease, most commonly cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord membranes) or disseminated cryptococcosis (infection spreading throughout the body). *C. gattii* can also cause serious illness in apparently healthy individuals.",

    "general_advice": "Cryptorchidism, or undescended testicle(s), is a condition present at birth in which one or both testes have not moved down into their proper position in the scrotum. Testes develop in the abdomen during fetal development and normally descend into the scrotum shortly before birth or within the first few months after birth. An undescended testicle may be located anywhere along the path of descent (e.g., in the abdomen, inguinal canal/groin) or sometimes in an abnormal (ectopic) location. It's more common in premature infants. While many undescended testes will descend on their own within the first 3-6 months of life, those that remain undescended require treatment. Untreated cryptorchidism can lead to reduced fertility, an increased risk of testicular cancer later in life, testicular torsion, and inguinal hernias.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Cryptorchidism is usually detected by a doctor during routine newborn or infant check-ups. If a testicle has not descended by 4-6 months of age, referral to a pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon is typically recommended to discuss treatment options, usually surgical.",

    "general_advice": "Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. This can occur due to: 1) Exogenous Cushing's syndrome: Taking corticosteroid medications (like prednisone) in high doses over a long period (most common cause). 2) Endogenous Cushing's syndrome: The body produces too much cortisol. This can be due to a pituitary gland tumor secreting excess ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol (this is called Cushing's disease); an adrenal gland tumor producing excess cortisol; or, rarely, an ACTH-producing tumor elsewhere in the body (ectopic ACTH syndrome). Symptoms can include: weight gain, particularly in the face ('moon face'), between the shoulders ('buffalo hump'), and abdomen; thin arms and legs; easy bruising; purple or pink stretch marks (striae) on the skin; thinning, fragile skin; slow healing of cuts; acne; increased body and facial hair (hirsutism) in women; irregular menstrual periods; muscle weakness; fatigue; high blood pressure; high blood sugar (diabetes); mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression); and bone loss (osteoporosis).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, especially if you are on long-term corticosteroid therapy or have unexplained weight gain with other characteristic features, consult a doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis involves tests to measure cortisol levels (e.g., 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, dexamethasone suppression test) and further tests to determine the underlying cause (e.g., ACTH levels, imaging of pituitary/adrenal glands).",

People with CF are prone to serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system, but can also impact other organs like the pancreas, liver, intestines, and reproductive system. It's caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, which leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus and abnormally salty sweat. In the lungs, this thick mucus clogs airways, traps bacteria (leading to chronic infections, inflammation, and progressive lung damage), and makes breathing difficult. In the pancreas, it blocks the release of digestive enzymes, leading to poor absorption of nutrients (especially fats) and malnutrition. Symptoms can vary in severity and age of onset but may include: persistent cough with thick mucus, frequent lung infections (pneumonia, bronchitis), wheezing, shortness of breath, poor growth or weight gain despite good appetite (failure to thrive in infants), greasy, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea), salty-tasting skin, and male infertility.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "CF is often diagnosed in infancy through newborn screening programs. If not detected at birth, consult a doctor if a child or adult has persistent respiratory or digestive symptoms suggestive of CF, or a family history of the disease.

Neurocysticercosis can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Cysticercosis is a parasitic tissue infection caused by larval cysts (cysticerci) of the pork tapeworm, *Taenia solium*. Humans become infected by ingesting *T. solium* eggs, usually through food or water contaminated with fecal matter from a human tapeworm carrier, or by autoinfection in a person with an adult tapeworm. When the eggs hatch in the intestine, the larvae can travel through the bloodstream to various tissues and form cysts. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) occurs when these cysts form in the brain or spinal cord and is the most serious form of the disease, being a major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. Cysts can also form in muscles, eyes, or skin. Symptoms depend on the number, size, location, and stage (viable, degenerating, calcified) of the cysts. For NCC, common symptoms include seizures, headaches, hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the brain), neurological deficits, and cognitive impairment. Muscle cysts may cause lumps or mild pain. Eye cysts can cause vision problems.",

Risk factors for DVT include: prolonged immobility (e.g., long travel, bed rest after surgery or illness), major surgery (especially orthopedic surgery of hip/knee), trauma or injury to a vein, cancer and its treatments, inherited blood clotting disorders (thrombophilia), hormone therapy or hormonal contraceptives, pregnancy and postpartum period, obesity, smoking, older age, and varicose veins.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of a DVT (e.g., unexplained pain, swelling, tenderness, redness, or warmth in a limb, especially if one-sided), see a doctor immediately or go to an emergency department. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent PE. Diagnosis often involves ultrasound (Doppler ultrasound) of the affected limb and sometimes blood tests (like D-dimer).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "DVT requires medical treatment, usually with anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) like heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs - e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran). These prevent new clots from forming and existing clots from growing larger.",
      "Follow your doctor's instructions for anticoagulant therapy meticulously (duration, dosage, monitoring if needed - e.g., INR for warfarin).",
      "Compression stockings: May be recommended to improve blood flow and reduce swelling and pain.",
      "Elevation of the affected limb can help reduce swelling.",
      "Early ambulation (walking) is often encouraged once anticoagulation is started, as appropriate.",
      "In some severe cases, procedures like thrombolysis (clot-busting drugs delivered via catheter) or thrombectomy (surgical removal of the clot) may be considered.",
      "Prevention of DVT is important, especially if you have risk factors:",
      "  - During long travel: Get up and walk around frequently, do leg/foot exercises while seated, wear compression stockings, stay hydrated.",
      "  - After surgery or during illness: Follow instructions for early mobilization, use prescribed DVT prophylaxis (e.g., anticoagulants, compression devices).",

    "emergency_advice": "While DDD is usually a chronic condition, seek immediate medical attention if back or neck pain is accompanied by: sudden loss of bladder or bowel control, progressive weakness or numbness in legs or arms, saddle anesthesia (numbness in groin/buttocks), or if pain is severe and unrelenting after a new injury. These could indicate a serious neurological emergency like cauda equina syndrome or acute severe nerve compression.",
    "general_advice": "Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is not actually a 'disease' but rather a condition that describes the natural changes that occur in the spinal discs as people age. Intervertebral discs are soft, compressible shock absorbers between the vertebrae of the spine. With age, these discs can lose fluid (dehydrate), become thinner, less flexible, and more prone to tearing or bulging. These changes can lead to pain, stiffness, and sometimes nerve-related symptoms if the degenerated disc presses on nearby spinal nerves or the spinal cord. DDD can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (mid-back), or lumbar (low back) spine. Symptoms vary widely; some people have no pain, while others experience chronic pain that can range from mild to severe, and may be localized or radiate to other areas (e.g., sciatica if a lumbar disc affects the sciatic nerve). Pain is often worse with certain activities (like sitting, bending, lifting, twisting) and may improve with rest or changing positions.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent back or neck pain, or radiating pain, numbness, or weakness, consult a doctor (primary care, physiatrist, orthopedist, or neurosurgeon).

    "general_advice": "Dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay or cavities, is the destruction of tooth structure caused by acids produced by bacteria in dental plaque. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that constantly forms on teeth. When you consume sugary or starchy foods and drinks, the bacteria in plaque feed on these sugars and produce acids that attack the tooth enamel (the hard outer layer of the tooth). Over time, repeated acid attacks can cause the enamel to demineralize and break down, forming a cavity. If left untreated, decay can progress through the dentin (the layer beneath enamel) and reach the pulp (the innermost part of the tooth containing nerves and blood vessels), leading to pain, infection (abscess), and eventual tooth loss. Early decay may not cause symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms can include toothache (spontaneous or when biting), tooth sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet, visible holes or pits in teeth, and brown, black, or white staining on tooth surfaces.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Regular dental check-ups (usually every 6 months) are essential for early detection and treatment of dental caries, often before they cause symptoms. If you experience toothache, sensitivity, or notice signs of decay, see your dentist promptly.

It's different from diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), as DI is not related to blood sugar levels but rather to a problem with the body's ability to regulate fluid balance. There are different types: 1) Central DI: The most common type, caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin), which is produced in the hypothalamus and stored/released by the pituitary gland. ADH tells the kidneys to reabsorb water. Causes include damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland (e.g., from tumor, surgery, head injury, inflammation, or idiopathic). 2) Nephrogenic DI: The kidneys are unable to respond properly to ADH. Can be inherited or caused by certain medications (e.g., lithium), kidney disease, or electrolyte imbalances. 3) Gestational DI: Occurs during pregnancy when an enzyme made by the placenta breaks down the mother's ADH. 4) Dipsogenic DI (Primary Polydipsia): Caused by excessive fluid intake due to a defect in the thirst mechanism or psychological factors, leading to suppression of ADH.",

As a result, the body starts breaking down fat for fuel, which produces acidic waste products called ketones. When ketones build up in the blood, they make it acidic, leading to DKA. DKA is often triggered by an illness or infection, missed insulin doses or inadequate insulin therapy, or newly diagnosed, untreated type 1 diabetes. High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) are usually present, along with high ketone levels in the blood and/or urine.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if DKA is suspected. Diagnosis involves blood tests for glucose, ketones, electrolytes, blood gases (to check acidity), and kidney function, as well as urine tests for ketones and glucose.",

    "general_advice": "Diabetic kidney disease, also known as diabetic nephropathy, is a common and serious complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It's a progressive condition where high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels (glomeruli) in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. Over time, this damage impairs the kidneys' ability to filter properly, leading to a buildup of waste products and fluid in the body, and leakage of protein (especially albumin) into the urine. High blood pressure, also common in diabetes, further contributes to kidney damage. In its early stages, diabetic kidney disease often has no symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms may include: swelling in feet, ankles, legs, or around eyes (edema); foamy urine (due to protein); increased need to urinate, especially at night; fatigue; loss of appetite; nausea; itching; and difficulty concentrating. It can eventually lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or kidney transplant.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have diabetes, regular screening for diabetic kidney disease is crucial. This involves annual urine tests (to check for albumin - microalbuminuria is an early sign) and blood tests (to measure creatinine and estimate glomerular filtration rate - eGFR). Early detection and management can help slow the progression of kidney damage.

These could indicate a vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment, which are sight-threatening emergencies.",
    "general_advice": "Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). Chronically high blood sugar levels damage these blood vessels, causing them to leak fluid or blood, or to become blocked. There are two main stages: 1) Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR): Early stage, where blood vessels weaken and may leak, causing retinal swelling (macular edema, a common cause of vision loss) or form small outpouchings (microaneurysms). 2) Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR): Advanced stage, where damaged blood vessels close off, leading to the growth of new, abnormal, fragile blood vessels on the retina (neovascularization). These new vessels can bleed into the vitreous (vitreous hemorrhage), cause scar tissue formation (which can pull on the retina, leading to retinal detachment), or cause neovascular glaucoma. Diabetic retinopathy often has no symptoms in its early stages, but can eventually lead to blurred vision, floaters, dark spots, difficulty seeing colors, and progressive vision loss if untreated.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have diabetes, regular comprehensive dilated eye exams with an ophthalmologist or optometrist experienced in diabetic eye care are crucial for early detection and treatment (usually annually, or more often if retinopathy is present).

Keep the head, neck, and back aligned and as still as possible to prevent further injury to the spinal cord. Await professional emergency medical personnel for safe immobilization and transport.",
    "general_advice": "A vertebral dislocation occurs when one vertebra (bone of the spine) is displaced from its normal alignment with the vertebra above or below it. This usually results from high-energy trauma, such as a motor vehicle accident, a fall from height, or a severe sports injury. It often involves extensive ligamentous damage and is frequently associated with vertebral fractures. The displacement can compress or transect the spinal cord or nerve roots, leading to severe neurological deficits, including paralysis, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder/bowel control below the level of injury. Dislocations can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (mid-back), or lumbar (low back) spine. Cervical dislocations are particularly dangerous due to the proximity to the brainstem and nerves controlling breathing.",

These disorders often develop as a coping mechanism in response to trauma, particularly severe, chronic trauma experienced during childhood (e.g., physical, sexual, or emotional abuse). Dissociation is a way the mind distances itself from overwhelming experiences. Types of dissociative disorders include: 1) Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID, formerly Multiple Personality Disorder): Characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession. 2) Dissociative Amnesia: Inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. May involve dissociative fugue (sudden, unexpected travel away from home with inability to recall one's past). 3) Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder: Persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization (feeling detached from one's own mental processes or body, like an outside observer) and/or derealization (experiencing the external world as unreal, dreamlike, or distorted).",

ADRs can range from mild (e.g., drowsiness, nausea, rash) to severe and life-threatening. A drug allergy is a specific type of ADR where the immune system overreacts to a medication, treating it as a harmful foreign substance (allergen). Allergic reactions can vary from mild skin rashes or hives to severe anaphylaxis. Other ADRs are not immune-mediated and can be due to side effects (predictable, dose-related effects), drug interactions, or individual intolerance. Almost any drug can cause an ADR. Common symptoms of milder reactions include skin rash, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache.",

For opioids: while usually not directly life-threatening, severe dehydration from vomiting/diarrhea, or suicidal ideation due to extreme discomfort can be emergencies. Medically supervised detoxification is often necessary and always recommended for alcohol and sedative-hypnotics.",
    "general_advice": "Drug withdrawal syndrome (or abstinence syndrome) is a set of physical and psychological symptoms that occur when a person who has developed physical dependence on a substance (due to regular, prolonged use) suddenly stops or significantly reduces their intake of that substance. The body has adapted to the presence of the drug, and when it's removed, it reacts with a rebound effect, often producing symptoms opposite to those caused by the drug. Symptoms vary greatly depending on the specific drug, the amount and duration of use, and individual factors. Common withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, depression, irritability, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, sweating, tremors, cravings, and in some cases, more severe symptoms like seizures or psychosis.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are planning to stop using a substance to which you may be dependent, or if you are experiencing withdrawal symptoms, it is crucial to consult a doctor or addiction specialist.

This results in dryness, irritation, and inflammation of the eye surface. When the cause is not readily identifiable from common factors (like aging, medications, environment, or specific diseases), it might be considered idiopathic or of unknown cause pending further investigation. Symptoms of dry eye can include: stinging, burning, or scratchy sensation in the eyes; redness; blurred vision (especially when reading or using screens); sensitivity to light (photophobia); watery eyes (a reflex response to irritation); stringy mucus in or around the eyes; and difficulty wearing contact lenses. It can be a chronic and progressive condition for some.",

If severe symptoms occur after gastric surgery, contact your surgeon or go to an ER.",
    "general_advice": "Dumping syndrome is a condition that can occur after surgery to remove all or part of the stomach (e.g., gastrectomy for cancer or ulcers) or after bariatric (weight-loss) surgery (e.g., gastric bypass). It happens when food, especially sugary or high-carbohydrate food, moves too quickly (is 'dumped') from the stomach into the small intestine (duodenum or jejunum) without being properly digested. This rapid emptying can cause two types of symptoms: 1) Early dumping (occurs 10-30 minutes after eating): Caused by the rapid shift of fluid from the bloodstream into the small intestine to dilute the concentrated food. Symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing, dizziness, lightheadedness, and rapid heartbeat. 2) Late dumping (occurs 1-3 hours after eating): Caused by a rapid rise in blood sugar after absorbing carbohydrates, followed by an excessive release of insulin, leading to reactive hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Symptoms include sweating, weakness, hunger, shakiness, anxiety, confusion, and dizziness.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have had stomach or bariatric surgery and experience symptoms of dumping syndrome, consult your doctor or surgeon. They can confirm the diagnosis and provide guidance on management. Sometimes, further testing may be needed to rule out other conditions.",

    "general_advice": "Eardrum damage, most commonly a perforated or ruptured eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation), is a hole or tear in the thin tissue that separates the ear canal from the middle ear. Causes can include: Middle ear infection (otitis media): Pus buildup can cause the eardrum to rupture. Barotrauma: Sudden changes in air pressure (e.g., during scuba diving, flying, or a forceful slap to the ear). Loud noise (acoustic trauma): A sudden, very loud noise like an explosion or gunshot. Foreign objects in the ear: Poking something too far into the ear canal (e.g., cotton swab, bobby pin). Severe head trauma. Symptoms can include: ear pain (may be sudden and sharp, then subside), clear, pus-like, or bloody drainage from the ear, hearing loss or muffled hearing, ringing in the ear (tinnitus), a whistling sound when blowing the nose, and sometimes dizziness or vertigo.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you have a perforated eardrum, see a doctor (primary care or ENT specialist).

    "general_advice": "Earwax (cerumen) is a natural substance produced by glands in the ear canal. It helps to clean, lubricate, and protect the ear canal by trapping dirt and repelling water. Normally, earwax gradually moves out of the ear canal on its own, carrying debris with it. Earwax impaction occurs when earwax builds up and blocks the ear canal. This can happen if the ear produces too much wax, if the wax is unusually dry or hard, if the ear canal is narrow or oddly shaped, or if attempts to clean the ear (e.g., with cotton swabs) push the wax deeper into the canal. Symptoms of impaction can include: earache or feeling of fullness in the ear, muffled hearing or partial hearing loss in the affected ear, ringing in the ear (tinnitus), dizziness (vertigo), itching in the ear canal, and sometimes a cough (due to nerve stimulation).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of earwax impaction, or if you are unsure if wax is the cause of your symptoms, see a doctor (primary care or ENT specialist). They can safely examine your ear canal and remove impacted wax if necessary (e.g., by manual removal with special instruments, irrigation/syringing, or suction). Do not attempt to remove impacted wax yourself with objects like cotton swabs, bobby pins, or ear candles, as this can push the wax further in, damage the ear canal or eardrum, or cause injury.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If you have a history of mild wax buildup and no eardrum perforation or ear tubes, you can try home remedies to soften wax:",
      "  - Apply a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, hydrogen peroxide (diluted), or commercial earwax softening drops into the ear canal once or twice a day for a few days. This can help soften the wax so it can come out on its own.",
      "  - After softening, you can gently irrigate the ear with a bulb syringe and lukewarm water (be very gentle, and only if you have no history of eardrum problems or ear surgery). Tilt your head to allow water to drain out.",
      "Avoid over-cleaning your ears; earwax is normal and protective.",

It can also occur in the ovary, cervix, or abdominal cavity. An ectopic pregnancy cannot proceed normally and the fertilized egg cannot survive. As the pregnancy grows in an abnormal location, it can cause the structure (e.g., fallopian tube) to rupture, leading to potentially life-threatening internal bleeding. Early symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can be similar to a normal early pregnancy (missed period, breast tenderness, nausea). As it progresses, symptoms may include: light vaginal bleeding or spotting, pelvic or abdominal pain or cramping (often one-sided), and shoulder pain. Risk factors include previous ectopic pregnancy, history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), previous pelvic or tubal surgery, endometriosis, certain STIs, use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception (though overall pregnancy risk is low with IUDs, if pregnancy does occur, it's more likely to be ectopic), and smoking.",

This leaves the inner surface of the eyelid exposed and prone to irritation. It can also prevent tears from draining properly through the tear ducts, as the lower eyelid normally helps to sweep tears towards the drainage system. Causes of ectropion include: age-related weakening of the connective tissues and muscles of the eyelid (most common cause - involutional ectropion), scarring from burns or trauma (cicatricial ectropion), facial nerve palsy (e.g., Bell's palsy, causing muscle weakness - paralytic ectropion), mechanical factors (e.g., a tumor or swelling on the eyelid pulling it down), or congenital factors (rare). Symptoms include excessive tearing (epiphora, as tears don't drain properly), eye dryness, irritation, redness of the eyelid and conjunctiva, a gritty or sandy sensation, light sensitivity, and sometimes blurred vision or recurrent eye infections.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have an eyelid that turns outward and experience bothersome symptoms, consult an eye doctor (ophthalmologist).

There are many types of eczema, including: Atopic dermatitis (most common type, often starts in childhood, associated with allergies/asthma), Contact dermatitis (caused by irritants or allergens - see separate entry), Seborrheic dermatitis (affects oily areas like scalp, face, chest; causes dandruff or greasy, scaly patches), Dyshidrotic eczema (blisters on hands/feet - see separate entry), Nummular eczema (coin-shaped patches of irritated skin), and Stasis dermatitis (affects lower legs due to poor circulation). The exact cause of many types of eczema involves a combination of genetic factors (e.g., filaggrin gene mutations affecting skin barrier), immune system dysfunction, and environmental triggers.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent, bothersome, or severe eczema symptoms that are not well-controlled with self-care, or if you suspect an infection, consult a doctor (primary care or dermatologist). They can diagnose the type of eczema, identify potential triggers, and prescribe appropriate treatments, which may include stronger topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, oral medications (corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics for severe cases), or phototherapy.",

Immediate specialized neonatal/pediatric intensive care is often required from birth.",
    "general_advice": "Edwards syndrome, also known as Trisomy 18, is a rare and severe genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 18. This extra genetic material disrupts normal development, leading to multiple severe congenital malformations affecting virtually every organ system. Characteristic features include: severe intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight, distinctive facial features (e.g., small head - microcephaly, small jaw - micrognathia, low-set ears, prominent back of the head), clenched hands with overlapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet, severe congenital heart defects, kidney abnormalities, gastrointestinal defects, and profound intellectual disability and developmental delays. Sadly, most babies with Trisomy 18 die before or shortly after birth, or within the first year of life, due to life-threatening medical complications. A small percentage may survive longer but with significant health challenges.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Edwards syndrome is often diagnosed prenatally through screening tests (e.g., maternal serum screening, NIPT) and confirmed with diagnostic tests (e.g., chorionic villus sampling - CVS, or amniocentesis, followed by karyotype analysis). If diagnosed, a multidisciplinary team of specialists (geneticists, neonatologists, pediatric cardiologists, palliative care specialists, etc.) will be involved in counseling the parents and planning for care.",

Use your prescribed emergency action plan.",
    "general_advice": "Emphysema is a chronic lung disease and one of the main conditions that make up Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - chronic bronchitis is the other. In emphysema, the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs become damaged and lose their elasticity. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed, leading to fewer, larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This reduces the surface area of the lungs available for gas exchange (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out), making it difficult to breathe. The main cause of emphysema is long-term exposure to irritants, primarily cigarette smoke. Other causes include exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, occupational dusts/chemicals, and rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Symptoms develop gradually and include: shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with activity (progresses to shortness of breath at rest), chronic cough (may or may not produce mucus), wheezing, chest tightness, and unintentional weight loss in later stages. Emphysema is progressive and irreversible, but treatment can help manage symptoms and slow progression.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent respiratory symptoms, especially shortness of breath and a history of smoking, consult a doctor. Emphysema (as part of COPD) is diagnosed based on symptoms, medical history, physical exam, and lung function tests (spirometry is key).

    "general_advice": "Endocarditis, most commonly infective endocarditis (IE), is an infection and inflammation of the endocardium, which is the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves. It usually occurs when bacteria, fungi, or other germs from another part of your body (e.g., mouth, skin, gut) spread through the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart, particularly heart valves. The infection can form vegetations (clumps of bacteria/fungi, platelets, and fibrin) on the valves, which can damage or destroy them and can also break off and travel to other parts of the body (emboli), causing complications like stroke or organ damage. Risk factors include: pre-existing heart valve disease (e.g., rheumatic heart disease, bicuspid aortic valve, prosthetic heart valves), congenital heart defects, history of previous endocarditis, intravenous (IV) drug use, recent dental or medical procedures that can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, and poor dental hygiene. Symptoms can be vague and develop slowly or rapidly, and may include: fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, weakness, muscle or joint aches, pale skin, persistent cough, shortness of breath, new or changed heart murmur, unexplained weight loss, tiny reddish/purple spots on skin (petechiae), tender nodules on fingers/toes (Osler's nodes), painless flat spots on palms/soles (Janeway lesions), or blood in urine.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have risk factors for endocarditis and develop persistent, unexplained fever or other symptoms suggestive of IE, see your doctor promptly. Diagnosis involves blood cultures (to identify the infecting organism), echocardiogram (transthoracic and often transesophageal - TEE, to visualize vegetations and valve damage), EKG, and other tests. Treatment requires hospitalization and long-term antibiotics.",
    "self_care_tips": [

    "general_advice": "Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the endometrium, the lining of the uterus (womb). It's the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs. The vast majority of endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas. The most common symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding, particularly any vaginal bleeding after menopause. In premenopausal women, symptoms can include unusually heavy or prolonged menstrual periods, or bleeding between periods. Other less common symptoms may include abnormal, watery or bloody vaginal discharge, pelvic pain or pressure, or pain during intercourse. Risk factors include: older age (most common after menopause), obesity, unopposed estrogen exposure (e.g., estrogen therapy without progestin, polycystic ovary syndrome - PCOS, estrogen-producing tumors), tamoxifen use (for breast cancer), early menarche/late menopause, never having been pregnant, family history of endometrial or colorectal cancer (e.g., Lynch syndrome), diabetes, and endometrial hyperplasia (see separate entry).",

    "general_advice": "Endometrial hyperplasia is a condition where the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) becomes abnormally thick. It's not cancer, but it can sometimes be a precursor to endometrial cancer, especially if it involves atypical cells (endometrial hyperplasia with atypia). It's usually caused by an imbalance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone, specifically too much estrogen relative to progesterone (unopposed estrogen). Estrogen stimulates the endometrium to grow, while progesterone helps to regulate this growth and prepare the lining for shedding during menstruation. Causes of unopposed estrogen include: perimenopause (when ovulation becomes irregular), obesity (fat cells convert other hormones to estrogen), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), estrogen therapy without adequate progestin, and certain estrogen-producing tumors. The most common symptom is abnormal uterine bleeding, such as heavy or prolonged menstrual periods, bleeding between periods, or any vaginal bleeding after menopause.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding or significant changes in your menstrual pattern, consult your doctor or gynecologist.

Severe pain unresponsive to usual measures also warrants prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Endometriosis is a chronic and often painful condition in which tissue similar to the lining inside the uterus (the endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This misplaced tissue (implants) can be found on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, outer surface of the uterus, pelvic lining, and sometimes on the bowel, bladder, or other organs. Like the uterine lining, these implants respond to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, thickening, breaking down, and bleeding each month. However, because this blood has no way to exit the body, it can cause inflammation, pain, scar tissue formation (adhesions), and cysts (endometriomas, often on ovaries - 'chocolate cysts'). The exact cause is unknown, but theories include retrograde menstruation (menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through fallopian tubes into pelvis), immune system dysfunction, or spread of endometrial cells through blood/lymphatic system. Symptoms vary widely but commonly include: painful periods (dysmenorrhea), chronic pelvic pain, pain during or after sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), pain with bowel movements or urination (especially during periods), heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, nausea (especially during periods), and infertility.",

In adults, they are more common in the spinal cord. These tumors can be benign (slow-growing) or malignant (cancerous, more aggressive), though even benign ependymomas can be serious due to their location and potential to block cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow (leading to hydrocephalus) or press on vital brain/spinal cord structures. Symptoms depend on the tumor's location and size. In the brain, they can cause headaches, nausea/vomiting, balance problems, difficulty with coordination, weakness, seizures, or changes in personality/behavior. In the spinal cord, they can cause back pain, weakness or numbness in limbs, and bowel/bladder dysfunction.",

Prompt evaluation is needed to differentiate and treat appropriately.",
    "general_advice": "Epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis, a coiled tube located at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. It's often caused by a bacterial infection, which can spread from the urethra or bladder. In sexually active men (especially younger men), it's commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia or gonorrhea. In older men or those not sexually active, it's often caused by non-STI bacteria (e.g., *E. coli*) that can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), sometimes related to conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or recent urinary tract procedures. Non-infectious causes (e.g., chemical irritation, trauma, autoimmune) are less common. Symptoms usually develop gradually and include: pain and tenderness in one testicle (often starting at the back and spreading), swelling and redness of the scrotum, warmth in the scrotum, pain or burning during urination (dysuria), frequent or urgent need to urinate, discharge from the penis, and sometimes fever or chills.",

Cranial epidural hematomas are most common and are usually caused by a skull fracture from head trauma (e.g., fall, assault, motor vehicle accident) that tears an artery (often the middle meningeal artery) or a large venous sinus. The bleeding is arterial, so the hematoma can expand rapidly, compressing the brain and increasing intracranial pressure. This can lead to severe brain damage or death if not evacuated quickly. The classic presentation involves a brief loss of consciousness at the time of injury, followed by a 'lucid interval' where the person seems fine, and then a rapid decline in neurological status. However, not everyone has this classic pattern.",

Tardive dyskinesia, while usually chronic, should also be evaluated promptly if new or worsening.",
    "general_advice": "Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are drug-induced movement disorders that arise from the blockade of dopamine receptors in the brain, particularly in the nigrostriatal pathway (part of the extrapyramidal system, which controls motor function). They are most commonly associated with antipsychotic medications (neuroleptics), especially older, first-generation (typical) antipsychotics, but can also occur with some second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (usually at higher doses) and certain antiemetic drugs (like metoclopramide, prochlorperazine). Types of EPS include: 1) Acute dystonia: Sudden, involuntary muscle contractions or spasms (e.g., torticollis - neck twisting, oculogyric crisis - eyes rolling upwards, opisthotonos - arching of back). 2) Akathisia: A state of inner restlessness and inability to sit still; a compelling urge to move. 3) Parkinsonism (drug-induced): Symptoms mimicking Parkinson's disease (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia/slow movement, shuffling gait). 4) Tardive dyskinesia (TD): A late-onset, often irreversible syndrome of involuntary, repetitive movements, typically of the face, tongue, lips (e.g., lip smacking, chewing motions, tongue protrusion), and sometimes limbs or trunk. Can develop after long-term antipsychotic use.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or someone you know develops any new or concerning movement-related symptoms while taking antipsychotic or other implicated medications, contact the prescribing doctor immediately. Do not stop or change medication dosage without medical advice. The doctor may adjust the dose, switch to a different medication with a lower EPS risk, or prescribe medications to treat the EPS (e.g., anticholinergics like benztropine for acute dystonia or parkinsonism; beta-blockers or benzodiazepines for akathisia; VMAT2 inhibitors like valbenazine or deutetrabenazine for tardive dyskinesia).",

This could indicate an underlying acute neurological problem (e.g., stroke, tumor, cranial nerve palsy). In children, any new or persistent eye turn should be evaluated by an eye doctor.",
    "general_advice": "Eye alignment disorder, commonly known as strabismus or squint, is a condition in which the eyes do not look at the same point at the same time; they are misaligned. One eye may turn inward (esotropia - 'crossed eyes'), outward (exotropia - 'wall-eyed'), upward (hypertropia), or downward (hypotropia). Strabismus can be constant or intermittent. It can occur in children or adults. In children, if not corrected, strabismus can lead to amblyopia ('lazy eye'), where the brain suppresses the image from the misaligned eye, resulting in poor vision development in that eye. In adults, new-onset strabismus often causes double vision (diplopia). Causes of strabismus can include: problems with eye muscle control (most common in children), uncorrected refractive errors (farsightedness can cause esotropia), genetic factors, nerve damage (cranial nerve palsies), brain conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, stroke, tumor), eye injuries, or certain systemic diseases (e.g., thyroid eye disease).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice any eye misalignment in your child, or if you develop new-onset strabismus or double vision as an adult, consult an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or pediatric ophthalmologist). Early detection and treatment are crucial, especially in children, to prevent amblyopia and allow for normal binocular vision development. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive eye exam, including tests of eye alignment and movement.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment depends on the type, cause, and severity of strabismus and is guided by an ophthalmologist.",
      "  - Eyeglasses: May be prescribed to correct refractive errors that contribute to strabismus.",

This may involve emergency medical care for the physical harm and/or emergency psychiatric evaluation. If factitious disorder imposed on another (e.g., a child) is suspected, child protective services or law enforcement must be contacted immediately due to risk of abuse.",
    "general_advice": "Factitious disorder is a serious mental health condition in which a person deliberately produces, feigns (fakes), or exaggerates physical or psychological symptoms in themselves (Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self, formerly Munchausen syndrome) or in another person under their care (Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another, formerly Munchausen syndrome by proxy - a form of abuse). The primary motivation is to assume the 'sick role' and gain attention, sympathy, or care from others, not for external rewards like financial gain or avoiding work (which would be malingering). Individuals may go to great lengths to create the appearance of illness, such as tampering with lab samples, injecting substances, falsifying medical records, or inducing injuries/illnesses. They often have extensive medical knowledge and a long history of hospitalizations or medical procedures. The behavior is compulsive and difficult to control.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Diagnosing factitious disorder can be very challenging, as individuals are often deceptive. If suspected, it usually requires careful observation by healthcare professionals and ruling out genuine medical conditions. Once suspected or diagnosed, psychiatric or psychological evaluation and treatment are essential. However, individuals with this disorder are often resistant to acknowledging it or seeking mental health treatment. If factitious disorder imposed on another is suspected, the safety of the potential victim is paramount, and reporting to authorities is mandatory.",

Floaters are very common and are usually caused by age-related changes in the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. As we age, the vitreous can liquefy and shrink, and tiny collagen fibers within it can clump together and cast shadows on the retina, which are perceived as floaters. This process is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and is a common cause of new floaters, especially in middle age and beyond. Most floaters are harmless and become less noticeable over time as the brain learns to ignore them. However, a sudden onset or increase in floaters can sometimes signal a more serious problem.",

Flu is different from the common cold; flu symptoms are usually more severe and come on more suddenly. Symptoms typically include: fever or feeling feverish/chills (though not everyone with flu will have a fever), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headache, fatigue (can be extreme), and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults). Most people recover from the flu within a few days to less than two weeks, but some can develop serious, life-threatening complications.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most healthy people with mild flu do not need to see a doctor. However, consult a doctor if you are at high risk for flu complications (e.g., young children under 5 - especially under 2, adults 65 and older, pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, weakened immune systems), or if your symptoms are severe or concerning. Antiviral medications (e.g., oseltamivir/Tamiflu, baloxavir/Xofluza) may be prescribed if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, especially for high-risk individuals, to shorten illness duration and reduce risk of complications.",

These can be signs of acute heart failure or other critical conditions.",
    "general_advice": "Fluid overload, also known as hypervolemia or fluid retention, occurs when there is too much fluid in the body, particularly in the bloodstream. This can happen if the body's mechanisms for regulating fluid balance are impaired, or if fluid intake exceeds the body's ability to excrete it. It's often a symptom or complication of underlying medical conditions, such as: Heart failure (heart can't pump blood effectively, leading to fluid backup), Kidney disease (kidneys can't excrete enough fluid and sodium), Liver disease/cirrhosis (can lead to fluid accumulation in abdomen - ascites, and legs), certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids, some blood pressure drugs like calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs), hormonal imbalances (e.g., SIADH - syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), or excessive intravenous (IV) fluid administration. Symptoms can include: swelling (edema) in the legs, ankles, feet, hands, or face; rapid weight gain; shortness of breath (especially with exertion or when lying flat); coughing; bloating or abdominal distension (ascites); fatigue; and sometimes high blood pressure or bulging neck veins.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience unexplained swelling, rapid weight gain, or increasing shortness of breath, consult your doctor. It's important to identify and treat the underlying cause of fluid overload.

    "general_advice": "Folate deficiency occurs when the body doesn't have enough folate (vitamin B9), an essential B vitamin. Folate plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and cell growth and division. A deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia (a type of anemia with abnormally large, immature red blood cells), fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, irritability, mouth sores (glossitis - sore, swollen tongue; angular cheilitis - cracks at corners of mouth), and changes in skin, hair, or nail color. In pregnant women, folate deficiency is a major risk factor for neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida, anencephaly) in the developing fetus. Causes of folate deficiency include: inadequate dietary intake (folate is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, beans, fortified grains), malabsorption disorders (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease), increased demand (e.g., during pregnancy, lactation, periods of rapid growth), certain medications (e.g., methotrexate, some anticonvulsants like phenytoin, sulfasalazine), and excessive alcohol consumption.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of folate deficiency or anemia, or if you have risk factors for deficiency (e.g., malabsorption, pregnancy, certain medications), consult your doctor. Diagnosis is made with a blood test to measure folate levels (and often vitamin B12, as deficiencies can coexist and symptoms overlap). A complete blood count (CBC) will show megaloblastic anemia if present.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment involves increasing folate levels through diet and/or supplementation.",
      "  - Folic acid supplements: Your doctor will likely prescribe folic acid tablets. Take as directed.",

      "If the deficiency is due to an underlying condition (e.g., malabsorption, medication), that condition needs to be addressed or medication adjusted if possible.",
      "Avoid excessive alcohol intake.",
      "Women of childbearing age, especially those planning pregnancy, should ensure adequate folic acid intake (often through a prenatal vitamin or separate supplement) to prevent neural tube defects. The recommendation is typically 400 mcg daily for all women of childbearing potential, and higher doses during pregnancy or if there's a history of neural tube defects.",

In severe cases, it can cause anaphylaxis. Common food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews, etc.), milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Food allergies are different from food intolerances (e.g., lactose intolerance), which do not involve the immune system and are generally less severe, though can cause significant discomfort.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you or your child has a food allergy, consult a doctor or allergist. Diagnosis involves a detailed medical history, physical exam, and may include skin prick tests, blood tests (for specific IgE antibodies), or an oral food challenge (done under strict medical supervision). If a food allergy is diagnosed, strict avoidance of the allergenic food is essential.",

    "emergency_advice": "While FRDA is a chronic, progressive condition, seek urgent medical attention for acute complications such as: sudden worsening of cardiac symptoms (chest pain, severe shortness of breath, palpitations, fainting - related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); signs of acute respiratory failure if scoliosis or muscle weakness is severe; or severe complications related to diabetes if present.",
    "general_advice": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare, inherited (autosomal recessive) neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and heart. It's caused by mutations in the FXN gene, leading to a deficiency of the protein frataxin. This deficiency causes damage to parts of the brain (especially the cerebellum and its pathways) and spinal cord, as well as peripheral nerves. Symptoms typically begin in childhood or adolescence (usually between ages 5 and 15, though late-onset forms exist) and progress over time. Key features include: progressive gait ataxia (unsteady, clumsy walking and balance problems), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), loss of coordination in arms and legs (dysmetria), muscle weakness (especially in legs), loss of sensation (vibration and position sense) in limbs, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and skeletal deformities (e.g., scoliosis - curvature of the spine, pes cavus - high-arched feet). A significant proportion of individuals also develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of the heart muscle), diabetes mellitus, and sometimes vision or hearing impairment.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a child or young adult develops progressive problems with balance, coordination, walking, or speech, consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist). Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, neurological exam, family history, and confirmed by genetic testing for mutations in the FXN gene. EMG/nerve conduction studies, MRI, echocardiogram, and other tests may be done to assess specific aspects.",

It's most common in children but can affect adults. It's contagious and can spread through direct contact with an infected person or animal (cats, dogs, farm animals), or indirectly through contaminated objects like combs, brushes, hats, towels, or bedding. Symptoms can vary but often include: itchy scalp, scaly patches (may be red or grayish, sometimes with a ring-like appearance), areas of hair loss or broken hairs (may leave black dots where hairs have broken off at the scalp surface), and sometimes dandruff-like flaking. In some cases, a more severe inflammatory reaction called a kerion can develop, which is a boggy, tender, pus-filled swelling that can lead to permanent scarring and hair loss if not treated promptly.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has symptoms of tinea capitis, consult a doctor or dermatologist. Diagnosis is often made by clinical appearance, but may involve examining skin scrapings or plucked hairs under a microscope (KOH prep) or fungal culture.

Severe hemolysis can lead to life-threatening anemia and kidney failure.",
    "general_advice": "G6PD deficiency is a common inherited (X-linked recessive) genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce enough of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This enzyme helps red blood cells function properly and protects them from damage caused by oxidative stress (from certain substances or infections). When red blood cells are exposed to oxidative stress without enough G6PD, they can break down prematurely (hemolysis), leading to hemolytic anemia. Most people with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic and unaware they have it unless they are exposed to a trigger. Triggers can include: certain medications (e.g., some antibiotics like sulfonamides, antimalarials like primaquine, aspirin in high doses, nitrofurantoin), fava beans (favism), certain infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonia), and severe stress. Symptoms of hemolysis include fatigue, pallor, jaundice, dark urine, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and sometimes an enlarged spleen.",

Also, if there's bloody nipple discharge or a breast lump, prompt evaluation is needed to rule out breast cancer.",
    "general_advice": "Galactorrhea is the production and leakage of a milky nipple discharge in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding, or in men. It can occur in one or both breasts. When the cause is not readily identified after a standard evaluation, it may be considered idiopathic or of unknown cause. However, a thorough investigation is always needed to rule out underlying causes. Common causes of galactorrhea include: 1) High levels of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia): Prolactin is the hormone responsible for milk production. This can be due to a benign pituitary tumor (prolactinoma), certain medications (e.g., some antipsychotics, antidepressants, antihypertensives, opioids), hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, or chest wall injury/stimulation. 2) Hormonal imbalances. 3) Excessive breast stimulation (e.g., frequent self-examination, sexual activity, irritation from clothing). 4) Stress. 5) Certain herbal supplements. The discharge is typically milky white or clear, but can sometimes be yellowish or greenish.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience nipple discharge that is not breast milk during pregnancy or lactation, consult your doctor (primary care, gynecologist, or endocrinologist). They will take a medical history, perform a breast exam, and likely order blood tests (e.g., prolactin level, thyroid function tests, pregnancy test). Imaging of the pituitary gland (MRI) may be done if prolactin levels are high or a pituitary tumor is suspected. If discharge is bloody or associated with a lump, mammogram/ultrasound and possibly biopsy will be needed.",

These could indicate cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation), cholangitis (bile duct infection), pancreatitis, or a stone blocking a bile duct.",
    "general_advice": "Gallstones (cholelithiasis) are hardened deposits of digestive fluid (bile) that can form in the gallbladder, a small organ located beneath the liver that stores and releases bile. Gallstones can vary in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. There are two main types: 1) Cholesterol stones: Most common, usually yellow-green, form when bile contains too much cholesterol, too little bile salts, or the gallbladder doesn't empty properly. 2) Pigment stones: Smaller and darker, made of bilirubin (a substance produced when red blood cells break down). More common in people with cirrhosis, biliary tract infections, or certain blood disorders. Many people with gallstones have no symptoms ('silent stones'). When symptoms occur (often called a 'gallbladder attack' or biliary colic), it's usually because a stone temporarily blocks the cystic duct (tube leading from gallbladder). This typically causes sudden, rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right or center of the abdomen, often radiating to the right shoulder or between the shoulder blades. Pain may last from 30 minutes to several hours and is often triggered by fatty meals. Nausea and vomiting may accompany the pain. Risk factors include female sex, age over 40, obesity, rapid weight loss, pregnancy, family history, diabetes, high-fat/low-fiber diet, and certain medications (e.g., estrogen).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of a gallbladder attack, consult your doctor. Diagnosis is usually made with an ultrasound of the abdomen. If complications are suspected, other tests (e.g., HIDA scan, CT, MRCP, ERCP) may be done.",

    "general_advice": "A ganglion cyst is a non-cancerous, fluid-filled lump or sac that commonly develops along tendons or joints, most often on the wrists (top or palm side), hands, fingers, or sometimes ankles and feet. The cyst is filled with a thick, jelly-like fluid similar to synovial fluid (joint lubricating fluid). The exact cause is often unknown, but they may arise from trauma, overuse, or degeneration of joint or tendon sheath tissue, leading to a small tear or outpouching that fills with fluid. Ganglion cysts can vary in size, may appear suddenly or grow gradually, and can fluctuate in size or even disappear on their own. They are usually round or oval and can feel firm or soft. Many are asymptomatic, but some can cause pain (especially if they press on a nearby nerve), tenderness, aching, weakness, or interfere with joint movement depending on their size and location.",

GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a muscular ring at the bottom of the esophagus, weakens or relaxes inappropriately, allowing stomach contents to reflux. Common symptoms include: heartburn (a burning sensation in the chest, often after eating or when lying down), acid regurgitation (sour or bitter taste in the mouth/throat), chest pain (non-cardiac), difficulty swallowing, sensation of a lump in the throat, chronic cough, laryngitis, hoarseness, or new/worsening asthma. Risk factors include obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, smoking, certain foods/drinks (fatty/fried foods, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, spicy/acidic foods), large meals, eating late at night, and some medications.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience frequent or severe GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn more than twice a week, symptoms interfering with daily life, or difficulty swallowing), consult your doctor (primary care or gastroenterologist). Chronic, untreated GERD can lead to complications like esophagitis, esophageal strictures, Barrett's esophagus (a precancerous condition), or esophageal cancer. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, but may involve endoscopy, esophageal pH monitoring, or manometry.",

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience: vomiting blood (hematemesis - can be bright red, dark red, or look like coffee grounds); passing black, tarry, foul-smelling stools (melena - indicates upper GI bleeding); passing bright red or maroon blood from the rectum (hematochezia - usually lower GI bleeding, but can be rapid upper GI bleed); accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, pale skin, sweating, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, confusion, or loss of consciousness (signs of significant blood loss and shock).",
    "general_advice": "Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage refers to bleeding anywhere in the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the rectum. It's a symptom of an underlying condition, not a disease itself. Upper GI bleeding (from esophagus, stomach, duodenum) is more common than lower GI bleeding (from small intestine, colon, rectum, anus). Causes of upper GI bleeding include: peptic ulcers (most common), esophageal varices (often from liver cirrhosis), Mallory-Weiss tears (tears in esophageal lining from forceful vomiting), esophagitis, gastritis, or tumors. Causes of lower GI bleeding include: diverticular disease (diverticulosis/diverticulitis), hemorrhoids, anal fissures, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis), polyps, colorectal cancer, angiodysplasia (abnormal blood vessels), or infections.

    "general_advice": "Gastroparesis, also known as delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine. This is not due to a physical blockage but rather to impaired stomach muscle function (motility), often involving damage to the vagus nerve, which controls stomach muscle contractions. The most common identifiable cause is diabetes (diabetic gastroparesis). Other causes include complications from some surgeries (e.g., gastric surgery, vagotomy), certain medications (e.g., opioids, some antidepressants, anticholinergics), viral infections, neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis), smooth muscle disorders (e.g., scleroderma), or idiopathic (unknown cause, common). Symptoms can include: nausea, vomiting (often undigested food hours after eating), early satiety (feeling full quickly), abdominal pain or bloating, heartburn, lack of appetite, weight loss, and fluctuations in blood sugar levels (as food absorption is unpredictable).",

    "general_advice": "Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is the more common cause of genital herpes, but HSV-1 (which usually causes oral herpes/cold sores) can also cause genital herpes through oral-genital contact. Many people with genital herpes have no symptoms or very mild symptoms that go unrecognized. When symptoms do occur (an 'outbreak'), they typically involve one or more painful blisters or open sores (ulcers) on or around the genitals (penis, vulva, vagina, cervix, anus), buttocks, or inner thighs. Before the blisters appear, there may be tingling, itching, or pain in the area. Outbreaks can also be accompanied by flu-like symptoms (fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes in groin) during the first episode. The blisters rupture, ooze, and then crust over and heal, usually within 2-4 weeks. After the initial infection, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate periodically, causing recurrent outbreaks, which are often shorter and less severe than the first. Triggers for recurrences can include stress, illness, fatigue, menstruation, or friction.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you have genital herpes (e.g., sores or blisters on genitals), see a doctor or go to an STI clinic. Diagnosis is best made by taking a swab from a fresh lesion for viral culture or PCR testing. Blood tests (for HSV antibodies) can detect past infection but may not distinguish between oral and genital herpes or pinpoint the timing of infection. There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications can help manage outbreaks.",

Also, any concerns about fetal well-being (e.g., significantly decreased fetal movement) require urgent evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women who did not previously have diabetes. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin (a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose get into cells for energy) to meet the increased demands of pregnancy, leading to high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Hormones produced by the placenta can also contribute to insulin resistance. GDM usually develops in the second or third trimester and often has no obvious symptoms, which is why screening is important. If symptoms do occur, they might include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, or blurred vision. Uncontrolled GDM can lead to complications for both the mother (e.g., preeclampsia, increased risk of C-section, developing type 2 diabetes later in life) and the baby (e.g., excessive birth weight/macrosomia leading to birth injuries, premature birth, low blood sugar/hypoglycemia after birth, respiratory distress syndrome, increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life).",

This is sight-threatening. For chronic glaucoma, sudden significant vision changes also warrant urgent evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, leading to progressive and irreversible vision loss, typically starting with peripheral (side) vision. It's often, but not always, associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP - pressure inside the eye). The most common type is Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG - see 'Chronic Glaucoma'), which is usually painless and develops slowly. Angle-Closure Glaucoma (ACG) occurs when the drainage angle in the eye becomes blocked, preventing fluid from draining properly; it can be acute (sudden, painful - an emergency) or chronic (gradual). Other types include Normal-Tension Glaucoma (optic nerve damage despite normal IOP), Congenital Glaucoma (present at birth), and Secondary Glaucoma (caused by other conditions like eye injury, inflammation, tumors, or medications like steroids). Untreated glaucoma can lead to blindness.",

If the person has an emergency steroid injection kit (e.g., hydrocortisone), administer it as instructed and still call for emergency help.",
    "general_advice": "Glucocorticoid deficiency, also known as adrenal insufficiency, occurs when the adrenal glands (located on top of the kidneys) do not produce enough glucocorticoid hormones, primarily cortisol. Cortisol plays a vital role in regulating stress response, metabolism, immune function, and blood pressure. There are two main types: 1) Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease): The adrenal glands themselves are damaged (often by an autoimmune process, but also by infections like TB, cancer, or bleeding). This usually involves deficiency of both cortisol and aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid that regulates salt/water balance). 2) Secondary adrenal insufficiency: The pituitary gland (in the brain) doesn't produce enough ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), which normally stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. This can be due to pituitary tumors, surgery, radiation, or abrupt cessation of long-term high-dose corticosteroid medication (which suppresses natural ACTH/cortisol production). Symptoms of chronic adrenal insufficiency develop gradually and can include: progressive fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, low blood pressure (especially orthostatic hypotension - dizziness upon standing), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, salt craving (in Addison's), darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation, especially in skin creases, scars, gums - characteristic of Addison's), irritability, and depression.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure cortisol and ACTH levels, and often an ACTH stimulation test (to see how adrenal glands respond).",

This could indicate rapid enlargement or compression of the airway or esophagus.",
    "general_advice": "A goiter is an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, the butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that regulate metabolism. A goiter can occur when the thyroid gland is overactive (hyperthyroidism, e.g., Graves' disease), underactive (hypothyroidism, e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis), or functioning normally (euthyroid). Causes include: Iodine deficiency (most common cause worldwide, but less so in areas with iodized salt), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune inflammation causing hypothyroidism, can initially cause goiter), Graves' disease (autoimmune condition causing hyperthyroidism and often diffuse goiter), thyroid nodules (single or multiple lumps in the thyroid, can cause goiter if large or numerous - multinodular goiter), thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid from other causes), pregnancy (hormonal changes can cause mild enlargement), or rarely, thyroid cancer.

Untreated, severe gout can lead to joint damage and kidney problems.",
    "general_advice": "Gout is a common and complex form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, often affecting the big toe (podagra). It's caused by hyperuricemia, which is an elevated level of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a waste product formed from the breakdown of purines (substances found naturally in the body and in certain foods). When uric acid levels are too high, urate crystals can form and deposit in joints and surrounding tissues, triggering an intense inflammatory response (a gout attack). Attacks often begin suddenly, frequently at night. If untreated, gout can become chronic, leading to more frequent and prolonged attacks, joint damage (gouty arthritis), and the formation of tophi (chalky deposits of urate crystals under the skin, often around joints, ears, or kidneys). Risk factors include: diet high in purines (red meat, organ meats, seafood like shellfish, anchovies, sardines), alcohol (especially beer and spirits), sugary drinks (fructose), obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, certain medications (e.g., diuretics, low-dose aspirin), and family history/genetics.",

The infection typically begins as small, painless nodules or papules that slowly enlarge and then break down to form beefy-red, velvety, raised, ulcerative lesions that bleed easily. These lesions are often described as 'granulomatous' and can gradually spread and destroy surrounding tissue if untreated. Unlike some other STIs, there is usually no associated lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop any persistent sores, ulcers, or unusual growths in the genital or groin area, consult a doctor or go to an STI clinic. Diagnosis is made by identifying Donovan bodies (bacteria within host cells) in tissue samples (smear or biopsy) taken from a lesion. Treatment with antibiotics is necessary to cure the infection and prevent further tissue damage and scarring.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If diagnosed with granuloma inguinale, take all prescribed antibiotics exactly as directed by your doctor. Treatment often involves a prolonged course (e.g., several weeks or until lesions have completely healed) of antibiotics like doxycycline, azithromycin, or ciprofloxacin.",
      "Keep the affected area clean and dry.",
      "Avoid sexual contact until you and any sexual partner(s) have completed treatment and lesions have fully healed.",

    "emergency_advice": "A 'thyroid storm' (thyrotoxic crisis) is a rare but life-threatening complication of severe, untreated or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism (often from Graves' disease), often precipitated by stress, infection, or surgery. Seek immediate emergency medical attention for: high fever, very rapid heartbeat (tachycardia, often >140 bpm), agitation, confusion, delirium, profuse sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, and sometimes heart failure or coma. Also, severe eye symptoms (Graves' ophthalmopathy) like significant proptosis (bulging eyes) causing inability to close eyes, severe eye pain, or vision loss need urgent ophthalmological care.",
    "general_advice": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland). In Graves' disease, the immune system produces antibodies (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins - TSIs) that mimic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), causing the thyroid gland to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). This leads to a sped-up metabolism and a wide range of symptoms, including: unintentional weight loss despite increased appetite, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation), nervousness, anxiety, irritability, tremors (fine shaking, often in hands), heat intolerance, increased sweating, fatigue, muscle weakness, changes in bowel habits (more frequent), goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), and sometimes sleep disturbances. Many people with Graves' disease also develop Graves' ophthalmopathy (thyroid eye disease - TED), which causes inflammation and swelling of tissues behind the eyes, leading to bulging eyes (proptosis), eye pain/pressure, double vision, redness, gritty sensation, and sometimes vision loss. A less common skin condition called Graves' dermopathy (pretibial myxedema - thick, reddish skin on shins) can also occur.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist).

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience rapidly ascending weakness or paralysis (often starting in legs and moving up), difficulty breathing or swallowing, severe pain, or autonomic dysfunction (e.g., unstable blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms). Hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit (ICU), is usually required for monitoring and treatment.",
    "general_advice": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system (the network of nerves outside the brain and spinal cord). This leads to inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath (insulation around nerve fibers) and sometimes the nerve axons themselves, impairing nerve signal transmission. GBS often follows a viral or bacterial infection (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni - common foodborne bacteria, influenza, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Zika virus) by a few days or weeks. The hallmark symptom is rapidly developing, usually symmetrical, muscle weakness, often starting in the legs and ascending to the arms and face. This can progress to paralysis. Other symptoms can include: tingling or numbness (paresthesias) in hands and feet, loss of reflexes, severe pain (neuropathic or musculoskeletal), difficulty with eye movements, facial weakness, difficulty swallowing or speaking, and problems with autonomic nervous system function (e.g., fluctuations in blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, bowel/bladder dysfunction).",

Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG or 'trench mouth') is a severe form requiring prompt treatment.",
    "general_advice": "Gum disease is an inflammation of the gums (gingiva) that can progress to affect the bone that surrounds and supports your teeth. It's primarily caused by bacteria in dental plaque, a sticky film that constantly forms on teeth. There are two main stages: 1) Gingivitis: The early, milder stage, where gums become red, swollen, and may bleed easily (e.g., when brushing or flossing). At this stage, the bone and connective tissue holding teeth in place are not yet affected, and it's reversible with good oral hygiene and professional cleaning. 2) Periodontitis: If gingivitis is untreated, it can advance to periodontitis. In periodontitis, the inflammation spreads below the gum line, causing gums to pull away from the teeth, forming pockets that become infected. The body's immune response to the bacteria and toxins can lead to breakdown of the bone and connective tissue that support the teeth. Teeth may become loose, shift, or eventually be lost. Symptoms of periodontitis include: swollen, red, tender, or bleeding gums; receding gums (teeth appear longer); persistent bad breath or bad taste; pus between teeth and gums; pain when chewing; loose teeth; and changes in the way teeth fit together when biting. Risk factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, diabetes, hormonal changes (e.g., pregnancy), certain medications, genetic susceptibility, and weakened immune system.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have any signs of gum disease, see your dentist or periodontist (gum specialist). Regular dental check-ups and professional cleanings are essential for preventing and managing gum disease. Treatment depends on the stage and severity.",

Also, if gynecomastia is causing significant pain or psychological distress.",
    "general_advice": "Gynecomastia is the enlargement of breast gland tissue in boys or men, caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Estrogen causes breast tissue to grow, while testosterone inhibits it. Gynecomastia is common and can occur at different life stages: 1) Neonatal: Due to maternal estrogen exposure in utero; usually resolves within weeks. 2) Pubertal: Due to hormonal fluctuations during puberty; often resolves on its own within months to a couple of years. 3) Senile (older men): Due to declining testosterone levels with age. Other causes can include: certain medications (e.g., some anti-androgens, anabolic steroids, some ulcer/heartburn drugs like cimetidine, some AIDS medications, some psychiatric drugs), illicit drugs (e.g., alcohol, marijuana, heroin, amphetamines), underlying medical conditions (e.g., hypogonadism - low testosterone, kidney failure, liver disease/cirrhosis, thyroid disorders, tumors of testes/adrenals/pituitary), obesity (can cause pseudogynecomastia - fat deposition without true gland enlargement, or true gynecomastia due to hormonal changes), or malnutrition/refeeding. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly. It may be asymptomatic or cause breast tenderness, pain, or nipple sensitivity.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice breast enlargement, tenderness, or a lump, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). They will take a medical history, perform a physical exam (to differentiate true gynecomastia from pseudogynecomastia and rule out breast cancer), and may order blood tests (hormone levels, liver/kidney/thyroid function) or imaging (mammogram or ultrasound if a lump is suspicious) to determine the cause.",
    "self_care_tips": [

    "general_advice": "A hammer toe is a deformity of a toe (usually the second, third, or fourth toe) in which the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal - PIP joint) is bent downward, causing the toe to look like an upside-down 'V' or a hammer. This can lead to pain, rubbing against shoes, and the formation of corns or calluses on the top of the bent joint or at the tip of the toe. Hammer toes often develop due to an imbalance in the muscles, tendons, or ligaments that normally keep the toe straight. Common causes include: wearing shoes that are too tight, narrow, or have high heels, which can crowd the toes; a toe that is longer than the big toe (second toe hammer toe is common); trauma or injury to the toe; arthritis; or certain neurological conditions. In early stages, a hammer toe may be flexible (can be manually straightened), but over time it can become rigid (fixed in the bent position).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a hammer toe that is painful, causing corns/calluses, or interfering with wearing shoes or walking, consult a doctor (primary care, podiatrist, or orthopedic foot specialist). They can assess the deformity and recommend appropriate treatment.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Wear comfortable, properly fitting shoes with a wide and deep toe box to accommodate the bent toe and reduce pressure. Avoid tight, narrow, or high-heeled shoes.",
      "Use over-the-counter corn pads or cushions to protect prominent areas and reduce friction.",
      "Gently stretch the affected toe if it's still flexible.",
      "If corns or calluses develop, you can gently file them down with a pumice stone after soaking the foot in warm water. Do not try to cut them yourself, especially if you have diabetes.",
      "Shoe inserts (orthotics) or toe splints/straps may be recommended by your doctor or podiatrist to help reposition the toe or relieve pressure.",
      "If conservative measures don't relieve pain or if the deformity is severe or rigid, surgical correction may be considered. Surgery can involve releasing tight tendons, removing a small piece of bone, or fusing the joint to straighten the toe."

Also, if experiencing acute, severe symptoms related to an associated goiter (e.g., difficulty breathing/swallowing).",
    "general_advice": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and gradually destroys the thyroid gland. This leads to chronic inflammation of the thyroid and often results in an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), where the thyroid gland cannot produce enough thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) to meet the body's needs. Hashimoto's is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas with sufficient iodine intake. It's more common in women and often has a genetic component. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms, or the thyroid gland may be enlarged (goiter) but functioning normally or even slightly overactive (hashitoxicosis, transient). As the disease progresses and hypothyroidism develops, symptoms can include: fatigue, sluggishness, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, unexplained weight gain, dry skin, hair loss or thinning/brittle hair, puffy face, hoarse voice, muscle aches/weakness/stiffness, joint pain/stiffness, heavy or irregular menstrual periods, depression, impaired memory or concentration ('brain fog'), and an enlarged thyroid (goiter).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism or have a goiter, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels (TSH - usually high in hypothyroidism, and free T4 - usually low) and thyroid antibody tests (anti-thyroid peroxidase - TPO antibodies, and anti-thyroglobulin - Tg antibodies, which are usually elevated in Hashimoto's). A thyroid ultrasound may also be done.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If hypothyroidism develops, treatment involves lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine (a synthetic form of T4). Take levothyroxine as prescribed, usually once daily on an empty stomach (e.g., 30-60 minutes before breakfast or several hours after dinner) to ensure proper absorption. Avoid taking it with certain medications or supplements (e.g., iron, calcium, antacids) that can interfere with absorption; discuss timing with your doctor or pharmacist.",

These could indicate a more serious complication like meningitis or intracranial hematoma (though rare).",
    "general_advice": "A post-lumbar puncture headache (PDPH), also known as a spinal headache, is a common complication that can occur after a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), a procedure where a needle is inserted into the lower back to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or administer medication. PDPH is thought to be caused by leakage of CSF through the puncture site in the dura mater (the membrane surrounding the spinal cord), leading to a decrease in CSF pressure and volume, which can cause the brain to sag slightly and pull on pain-sensitive structures. The headache is typically positional: it worsens significantly when sitting or standing up and is relieved or improves when lying flat. It's often described as throbbing or dull and may be located in the front (frontal) or back (occipital) of the head. It can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, dizziness, stiff neck, light sensitivity (photophobia), sound sensitivity (phonophobia), or blurred/double vision. Symptoms usually begin within 6 to 72 hours after the procedure.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop a headache after a lumbar puncture, especially if it's positional, contact the doctor who performed the procedure or your primary care doctor.

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention if heart block causes: severe dizziness, fainting (syncope) or near-fainting, extreme fatigue or weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a very slow heart rate (bradycardia) leading to significant symptoms. High-degree AV block (second-degree Mobitz II or third-degree/complete heart block) can be life-threatening and requires urgent management.",
    "general_advice": "Heart block, specifically atrioventricular (AV) block, is a type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) where the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are partially or completely blocked as they travel from the atria (upper chambers of the heart) to the ventricles (lower chambers). This can cause the heart to beat too slowly or irregularly, reducing blood flow to the brain and other organs. There are different degrees of AV block: 1) First-degree AV block: Electrical signals are slowed but all reach the ventricles; often asymptomatic and may not require treatment. 2) Second-degree AV block: Some signals don't reach the ventricles, causing skipped beats. Type I (Mobitz I or Wenckebach) is often less serious. Type II (Mobitz II) is more serious and can progress to complete heart block. 3) Third-degree AV block (Complete Heart Block): No electrical signals from the atria reach the ventricles. The atria and ventricles beat independently, with the ventricles usually contracting at a very slow escape rhythm. This is a serious condition. Causes of heart block can include damage to the heart's electrical system from coronary artery disease, heart attack, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, congenital heart defects, certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin), electrolyte imbalances, or age-related degeneration.",

They typically grow rapidly for the first few months (proliferative phase), then stabilize, and then slowly shrink and fade over several years (involuting phase), often disappearing by age 5-10, though some may leave residual skin changes or scarring. They can be superficial (bright red, raised), deep (bluish, under the skin), or mixed. Most are small and cause no problems, but large IHs or those in critical locations (e.g., near eyes, nose, mouth, airway, diaper area) can cause complications (e.g., vision obstruction, breathing problems, feeding difficulties, ulceration, bleeding). 2) Cherry angiomas: Small, bright red, benign skin growths that appear in adults, usually on the trunk.

This iron overload can damage these organs over time if not treated. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common form, caused by genetic mutations (most often in the HFE gene) that affect iron regulation. Secondary hemochromatosis can occur due to other conditions like chronic liver diseases, certain anemias requiring frequent blood transfusions (e.g., thalassemia), or excessive iron supplementation. Many people with hemochromatosis, especially in early stages, have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can be vague and include: fatigue, weakness, joint pain (arthralgia, often in hands/knuckles), abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, loss of libido, and skin bronzing or graying.

Seek immediate emergency medical attention or go to your hemophilia treatment center (HTC) for: any significant injury (especially to the head); unexplained or uncontrolled bleeding; severe pain or swelling in a joint or muscle; severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting, or neurological changes (could be intracranial bleed); blood in urine or stool; or abdominal pain with swelling. Administer prescribed clotting factor concentrate immediately if you have it and are trained to do so for a significant bleed, but still seek medical care.",
    "general_advice": "Hemophilia is a rare, inherited (usually X-linked recessive, so primarily affects males) bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly due to a deficiency or absence of specific clotting factor proteins. Hemophilia A (classic hemophilia) is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX (FIX). The severity of hemophilia (mild, moderate, or severe) depends on the amount of clotting factor present in the blood. People with hemophilia bleed for a longer time after an injury or surgery, and can also experience spontaneous bleeding, especially into joints (hemarthrosis - common in knees, elbows, ankles) and muscles. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to chronic pain, joint damage (hemophilic arthropathy), and disability. Bleeding into other areas (e.g., brain, internal organs) can be life-threatening.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Hemophilia is usually diagnosed in childhood, often after unexplained bleeding episodes or if there's a family history. Diagnosis is made with blood tests to measure clotting factor levels. Management should be coordinated through a specialized Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) with a multidisciplinary team.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "The mainstay of treatment is clotting factor replacement therapy: Infusions of concentrated clotting factor (FVIII or FIX) to replace the deficient factor. This can be given: 1) On-demand: To treat an active bleed. 2) Prophylactically: On a regular schedule (e.g., 2-3 times a week) to prevent bleeds, especially in severe hemophilia.

Seek emergency medical attention if a person with liver disease develops: significant confusion, disorientation, extreme drowsiness or lethargy, slurred speech, agitation, personality changes, seizures, or unresponsiveness. Even milder new or worsening HE symptoms warrant prompt medical evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric abnormalities that occur in people with advanced liver disease (acute liver failure or, more commonly, chronic liver disease/cirrhosis). It happens when the liver is too damaged to effectively remove toxins (like ammonia, produced by gut bacteria during protein digestion) from the blood. These toxins then travel to the brain and interfere with brain function. Symptoms can range from mild (subtle changes in thinking, mild confusion, mood changes, sleep disturbances - 'minimal HE') to severe (marked confusion, disorientation, drowsiness, slurred speech, personality changes, asterixis - a 'flapping tremor' of the hands, poor coordination, stupor, and coma). HE can be precipitated or worsened by factors like infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, certain medications (e.g., sedatives, diuretics), or excessive dietary protein in some cases.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a person with known liver disease develops any new or worsening neurological or mental status changes, they should be evaluated by their doctor (hepatologist/gastroenterologist) or go to an emergency department promptly.

    "general_advice": "A herniated disc (also called a slipped, ruptured, or bulging disc) occurs when the soft, gel-like center (nucleus pulposus) of an intervertebral disc pushes out through a tear or weak spot in the disc's tough outer layer (annulus fibrosus). Intervertebral discs act as cushions between the vertebrae (bones) of the spine. A herniated disc can occur in any part of the spine but is most common in the lumbar (lower back) and cervical (neck) regions. If the herniated disc material presses on a nearby spinal nerve root or the spinal cord, it can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the area of the body supplied by that nerve. Lumbar herniated disc often causes sciatica (pain radiating down the buttock and leg along the sciatic nerve). Cervical herniated disc can cause pain, numbness, or weakness radiating into the shoulder, arm, and hand. Herniation can result from gradual wear and tear (disc degeneration) with aging, or from a sudden strain or injury (e.g., improper lifting, twisting).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have back or neck pain that radiates into a limb, or is accompanied by numbness, tingling, or weakness, consult a doctor (primary care, physiatrist, orthopedist, or neurosurgeon).

    "general_advice": "A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach bulges up through an opening in your diaphragm (the hiatus) and into your chest cavity. The diaphragm is a large muscle that separates your abdomen from your chest and helps with breathing. There are two main types: 1) Sliding hiatal hernia (most common): The stomach and the section of the esophagus that joins the stomach slide up into the chest through the hiatus. 2) Paraesophageal hiatal hernia (less common but potentially more serious): Part of the stomach squeezes up through the hiatus alongside the esophagus, remaining next to it. Many small hiatal hernias cause no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are often related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) because the hernia can weaken the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing stomach acid to reflux into the esophagus. Symptoms can include: heartburn, acid regurgitation, chest pain or discomfort (can mimic heart pain), difficulty swallowing, belching, feeling of fullness after eating, and sometimes shortness of breath or nausea. Risk factors include age over 50, obesity, and conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., chronic coughing, straining, heavy lifting, pregnancy).",

Also, if a newborn fails to pass meconium within 24-48 hours of birth, or shows signs of intestinal obstruction (vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation).",
    "general_advice": "Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital condition affecting the large intestine (colon) that causes problems with passing stool. It occurs when nerve cells (ganglion cells) are missing from the muscles in a segment of the colon. These nerve cells are essential for normal bowel motility (the coordinated muscle contractions that move stool through the intestine). Without these nerves, the affected segment of the colon cannot relax and effectively push stool along, leading to a functional obstruction. The length of the affected segment can vary, from a short segment near the anus (most common) to the entire colon (rare). Symptoms usually appear shortly after birth, with most newborns failing to pass meconium (first stool) within the first 24-48 hours. Other symptoms in infants can include: abdominal swelling or distension, vomiting (may be green or brown), constipation or difficulty passing stool, poor feeding, and failure to thrive.

This fungus is commonly found in soil enriched with bird or bat droppings, particularly in certain river valleys (e.g., Ohio and Mississippi River valleys in the US, parts of Central/South America, Africa, Asia, Australia). Most people who inhale the spores do not get sick or only develop a mild, self-limiting, flu-like illness (acute pulmonary histoplasmosis) with symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, chills, headache, chest pain, and body aches, which usually resolve without treatment within a few weeks. However, in some individuals, especially those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, on immunosuppressive drugs), infants, or older adults, the infection can become severe and spread throughout the body (progressive disseminated histoplasmosis - PDH), affecting organs like the lungs, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, bone marrow, and central nervous system.

    "general_advice": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common group of related viruses. There are many different types of HPV, some of which can cause warts (papillomas) on various parts of the body, while others can lead to cancer. HPV is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact, most commonly during sexual activity (vaginal, anal, or oral sex). Most HPV infections cause no symptoms and clear on their own within a couple of years without causing health problems. However, persistent infection with certain high-risk HPV types can cause cellular changes that, over many years, can lead to cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of tongue and tonsils). Low-risk HPV types can cause genital warts (condyloma acuminata) - soft, fleshy growths on or around the genitals or anus - or common skin warts. There is no cure for the HPV virus itself once infection occurs, but the health problems it causes (warts, precancerous changes, cancer) can be treated.",

Also, if there's a high-risk exposure to HIV (e.g., unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner, needle stick), seek immediate medical care to discuss post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which must be started within 72 hours.",
    "general_advice": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells), which are crucial for fighting off infections. If left untreated, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system, leading to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely weakened, making the person highly susceptible to opportunistic infections (infections that wouldn't normally cause illness in people with healthy immune systems) and certain cancers. HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual contact (anal or vaginal), sharing contaminated needles or syringes (for IV drug use), or from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Early HIV infection may cause flu-like symptoms (fever, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, rash) within 2-4 weeks of exposure (acute retroviral syndrome), or it may be asymptomatic. Without treatment, HIV progresses through a chronic (latent) phase (often asymptomatic for years) to AIDS.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Get tested for HIV if you have engaged in any risk behaviors or if you have symptoms. Regular HIV testing is recommended for sexually active individuals and those with risk factors. If diagnosed with HIV, it is crucial to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 count. ART involves taking a combination of HIV medicines daily. While ART does not cure HIV, it can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, allowing the immune system to recover, preventing progression to AIDS, significantly improving health and lifespan, and preventing transmission to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U). Management should be by a doctor specializing in HIV care.",

Complications like hemorrhage or persistent trophoblastic disease require urgent management.",
    "general_advice": "A hydatidiform mole, commonly known as a molar pregnancy, is a rare complication of pregnancy characterized by abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue (the tissue that normally develops into the placenta) in the uterus. Instead of a viable fetus, a mass of abnormal tissue (often described as resembling a cluster of grapes) forms. There are two main types: 1) Complete hydatidiform mole: An egg with no genetic information is fertilized by one or two sperm, resulting in placental tissue with no fetus. 2) Partial hydatidiform mole: A normal egg is fertilized by two sperm (or one sperm that duplicates its chromosomes), resulting in abnormal placental tissue and often an abnormal, non-viable fetus. Molar pregnancies produce very high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the pregnancy hormone. Symptoms can include: vaginal bleeding (often dark brown to bright red, may be intermittent or continuous, can occur in first or early second trimester), severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum), larger-than-expected uterine size for gestational age, passage of grape-like vesicles from the vagina, and sometimes early development of preeclampsia or hyperthyroidism (due to hCG stimulation).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are pregnant and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding, severe nausea/vomiting, or if your uterus seems to be growing too quickly, consult your doctor or obstetrician immediately. Diagnosis is often made by ultrasound (showing characteristic 'snowstorm' appearance for complete mole, or abnormal fetus/placenta for partial mole) and very high hCG levels.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "A molar pregnancy cannot result in a live birth and requires prompt medical treatment to remove the abnormal tissue from the uterus, usually by suction dilation and curettage (D&C).",
      "Close follow-up care after removal is crucial to monitor hCG levels until they return to normal (non-pregnant levels). This is because some molar tissue can sometimes persist and develop into a rare form of cancer called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which is highly treatable if detected early. hCG monitoring may continue for 6 months to a year or more.",
      "It's very important to avoid getting pregnant again until hCG levels have been normal for the recommended period and your doctor gives clearance. Reliable contraception is necessary during this time.",

This could indicate a more serious condition like testicular torsion (a surgical emergency), epididymitis, or a strangulated inguinal hernia, which can sometimes present with scrotal swelling.",
    "general_advice": "A hydrocele is a collection of fluid in the sac that surrounds a testicle (tunica vaginalis), causing swelling in the scrotum. It's common in newborn male infants and often resolves on its own within the first year of life. In newborns, it's usually a 'communicating' hydrocele, meaning there's an open connection between the abdomen and the scrotum that allows peritoneal fluid to drain into the scrotum (this connection normally closes). In older boys and adult men, hydroceles can develop due to inflammation or injury to the testicle or epididymis, or sometimes for no apparent reason ('non-communicating' hydrocele, where the sac around the testicle produces too much fluid or doesn't absorb it properly). A hydrocele usually presents as a painless, soft swelling of one or both sides of the scrotum. The scrotum may feel like a water-filled balloon. It can sometimes cause a feeling of heaviness or mild discomfort if large. Hydroceles are generally not dangerous and do not affect fertility.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops scrotal swelling, see a doctor (pediatrician, urologist, or primary care) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of scrotal swelling (like inguinal hernia, varicocele, testicular tumor, or infection). Diagnosis is often made by physical exam (the swelling may transilluminate - light shines through it) and sometimes ultrasound.",

      "If a hydrocele is large, causing discomfort, heaviness, or cosmetic concern, treatment options include:",
      "  - Surgical repair (hydrocelectomy): This is the most common and effective treatment. The sac containing the fluid is surgically removed or altered to prevent fluid re-accumulation.",
      "  - Needle aspiration: Draining the fluid with a needle. This is less invasive but hydroceles often recur after aspiration alone. Sclerotherapy (injecting a sclerosing agent after aspiration to try and prevent recurrence) is sometimes done but has a higher complication rate and is less commonly used than surgery.",

Untreated or acutely worsening hydrocephalus can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles (fluid-filled cavities) of the brain. CSF normally circulates through the ventricles and around the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning and nutrients. Hydrocephalus occurs when there is an imbalance between CSF production and absorption, or a blockage in its flow, leading to an increase in CSF volume and pressure within the skull. This can cause the ventricles to enlarge and put pressure on brain tissue, potentially leading to brain damage. Hydrocephalus can be: 1) Congenital: Present at birth, often due to genetic abnormalities or developmental problems (e.g., aqueductal stenosis, spina bifida, Dandy-Walker syndrome). 2) Acquired: Develops after birth due to conditions like head injury, brain tumor, stroke, meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or complications of prematurity. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) is a type that typically affects older adults, with enlarged ventricles but often normal or intermittently elevated CSF pressure. Symptoms vary with age and severity. In infants: rapid increase in head circumference, bulging fontanelle, vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, downward deviation of eyes ('sunsetting'). In older children/adults: headache, nausea/vomiting, vision problems, balance/coordination difficulties, gait disturbance, cognitive decline (memory problems, confusion), urinary incontinence, lethargy, personality changes.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops symptoms suggestive of hydrocephalus, consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist, or neurosurgeon) immediately. Diagnosis involves a neurological exam and brain imaging (ultrasound for infants, CT or MRI for older children/adults). Sometimes intracranial pressure monitoring or CSF flow studies are done.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Hydrocephalus almost always requires surgical treatment to manage CSF flow and reduce pressure.",

A shunt is a surgically implanted tube system that diverts excess CSF from the brain ventricles to another part of the body where it can be absorbed (usually the abdomen - ventriculoperitoneal/VP shunt, or sometimes the heart or pleural space). Shunts have a valve to regulate flow and pressure.",

Bilateral hydronephrosis or hydronephrosis in a solitary kidney causing acute obstruction can rapidly lead to kidney damage.",
    "general_advice": "Hydronephrosis is the swelling or distension of one or both kidneys due to a buildup of urine. It occurs when there is a blockage or obstruction in the urinary tract that prevents urine from draining normally from the kidney(s) down to the bladder and out of the body. This backup of urine causes pressure to build in the kidney, which can lead to enlargement of the renal pelvis and calyces (the urine-collecting structures within the kidney) and, if prolonged or severe, can damage kidney tissue and impair kidney function. Causes of obstruction can occur at any level of the urinary tract: 1) Ureter: Kidney stones, tumors, blood clots, strictures (narrowing), congenital abnormalities (e.g., ureteropelvic junction - UPJ obstruction). 2) Bladder: Bladder stones, tumors, neurogenic bladder (impaired bladder function), bladder outlet obstruction. 3) Urethra: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men, urethral strictures, tumors. Pregnancy can also cause physiological hydronephrosis due to hormonal changes and pressure from the enlarging uterus. Symptoms depend on whether the obstruction is acute or chronic, unilateral or bilateral, and the underlying cause. Acute obstruction often causes severe flank pain (renal colic). Chronic hydronephrosis may be asymptomatic or cause dull flank pain, changes in urination (frequency, urgency, decreased output), nausea, vomiting, fever (if infection is present), or blood in the urine.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms suggestive of hydronephrosis or urinary obstruction, consult your doctor (primary care, urologist, or nephrologist).

This is the most frequent cause in outpatients. 2) Cancer (malignancy): Certain cancers can cause hypercalcemia, either by spreading to bones and causing calcium release, or by producing substances that raise calcium levels (e.g., parathyroid hormone-related protein - PTHrP). This is a common cause in hospitalized patients. Other causes include: certain medications (e.g., thiazide diuretics, lithium, excessive vitamin D or calcium supplements), prolonged immobilization, kidney disease, certain granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, tuberculosis), adrenal insufficiency, or rare genetic conditions.

However, too much cholesterol, particularly LDL (low-density lipoprotein, often called 'bad' cholesterol), can lead to atherosclerosis, where plaques build up in the arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This increases the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. High cholesterol usually causes no symptoms itself, which is why regular screening is important. Causes can include: diet high in saturated and trans fats, lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking, genetics (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia - an inherited condition causing very high cholesterol from a young age), older age, and underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney disease).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Regular cholesterol screening (lipid panel blood test) is recommended for adults (starting in young adulthood, or earlier if risk factors are present) as per guidelines. If your cholesterol levels are high, your doctor will discuss a management plan based on your overall cardiovascular risk profile.",

HG can be a serious condition requiring hospitalization.",
    "general_advice": "Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, far more intense and persistent than typical 'morning sickness.' It can lead to significant weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, ketosis (buildup of ketones due to fat breakdown for energy), and malnutrition if not managed effectively. The exact cause is unknown but is thought to be related to rapidly rising hormone levels (especially hCG and estrogen), though psychological and genetic factors may also play a role. HG usually begins in the first trimester (often by 5-6 weeks) and may persist throughout much of the pregnancy for some women, though it often improves by mid-pregnancy (around 20 weeks). Symptoms include: severe, persistent nausea and vomiting (often multiple times a day), inability to keep food or fluids down, significant weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, fatigue, and sometimes dizziness or lightheadedness. HG can significantly impact a woman's physical and emotional well-being and ability to function.",

    "general_advice": "Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive sweating that is not necessarily related to heat or exercise. The sweating can be so profuse that it soaks through clothing, drips from hands, or causes skin problems and social embarrassment. There are two main types: 1) Primary focal hyperhidrosis: The most common type, where excessive sweating occurs in specific areas (focal points) like the armpits (axillary hyperhidrosis), palms of the hands (palmar hyperhidrosis), soles of the feet (plantar hyperhidrosis), or face/scalp (craniofacial hyperhidrosis). It usually starts in childhood or adolescence, is often bilateral and symmetrical, and tends to stop during sleep. The cause is thought to be overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system controlling sweat glands; there's often a family history. 2) Secondary generalized hyperhidrosis: Excessive sweating that affects the entire body or larger areas, and is caused by an underlying medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, diabetes, menopause, infections, certain cancers like lymphoma, neurological disorders) or as a side effect of certain medications (e.g., some antidepressants, opioids, hormonal drugs). This type can occur at any age and may also occur during sleep.",

Even if asymptomatic, a very high potassium level found on a blood test requires urgent management.",
    "general_advice": "Hyperkalemia is a condition where the level of potassium in your blood is higher than normal. Potassium is an essential electrolyte that plays a critical role in nerve function, muscle contraction (including the heart muscle), and fluid balance. The kidneys are primarily responsible for excreting excess potassium. Causes of hyperkalemia include: 1) Impaired kidney function (acute or chronic kidney disease - most common cause, as kidneys can't remove potassium effectively). 2) Medications that affect potassium levels or kidney function (e.g., ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone, NSAIDs, beta-blockers, trimethoprim). 3) Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease - lack of aldosterone, which helps excrete potassium). 4) Excessive potassium intake (usually only a problem if kidney function is also impaired - from diet, salt substitutes containing potassium chloride, or potassium supplements). 5) Conditions causing potassium to shift out of cells into the bloodstream (e.g., tissue damage from burns or crush injuries, rhabdomyolysis, diabetic ketoacidosis, metabolic acidosis). 6) Pseudohyperkalemia (falsely elevated reading due to issues with blood draw or sample handling). Mild hyperkalemia may cause no symptoms. As levels rise, symptoms can occur (see emergency advice).",

    "general_advice": "Hypernatremia is an electrolyte imbalance characterized by an elevated sodium level in the blood. It usually results from a net water loss or, less commonly, a net sodium gain, leading to a relative deficit of water compared to sodium in the body. This causes body fluids to become too concentrated. The body normally regulates sodium and water balance through thirst and the kidneys' ability to concentrate or dilute urine (via antidiuretic hormone - ADH). Common causes include: 1) Inadequate water intake: Often in individuals who cannot express thirst or access water (e.g., infants, elderly, debilitated, impaired mental status). 2) Excessive water loss: From profuse sweating (e.g., during exercise in heat without adequate rehydration), severe diarrhea or vomiting, fever, burns, or conditions like diabetes insipidus (lack of ADH or kidney unresponsiveness to ADH, leading to excretion of large volumes of dilute urine). 3) Excessive sodium intake or retention (less common): e.g., administration of hypertonic saline solutions, salt poisoning (rare), primary hyperaldosteronism. Symptoms depend on the severity and rapidity of onset. Mild hypernatremia may cause thirst, dry mouth, restlessness, or irritability. As it worsens, symptoms can include lethargy, weakness, confusion, muscle twitching or spasticity, seizures, and coma.",

    "general_advice": "Hyperopia, commonly known as farsightedness or long-sightedness, is a refractive error where distant objects are usually seen clearly, but close-up objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is too short from front to back, or the cornea (clear front surface of the eye) or lens has too little curvature. This causes light entering the eye to focus behind the retina, instead of directly on it. Young people with mild to moderate hyperopia may not notice vision problems because their eyes' natural lenses can accommodate (change shape) to bring near objects into focus. However, this constant accommodative effort can lead to symptoms like eye strain, headaches (especially after close work like reading or computer use), fatigue, squinting, or difficulty concentrating on near tasks. As people age, the ability to accommodate decreases, and near vision problems become more apparent. Severe hyperopia can cause blurry vision at all distances. It can also be associated with an increased risk of certain eye conditions like accommodative esotropia (inward turning of eye in children) or angle-closure glaucoma (in adults).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child experiences blurry near vision, eye strain, headaches after close work, or other symptoms suggestive of hyperopia, schedule a comprehensive eye examination with an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience: fainting (syncope) or near-fainting, especially during or after physical exertion; severe chest pain; significant shortness of breath; or a very rapid or irregular heartbeat causing severe symptoms. HOCM can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young athletes, though this is rare. Any new or worsening symptoms warrant urgent evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), often just called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as obstruction is not always present, is a genetic heart condition where the heart muscle (myocardium), particularly of the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) and sometimes the septum (wall between ventricles), becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). This thickening can make it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively and can also stiffen the ventricle, impairing its ability to relax and fill with blood. In HOCM, the thickened septum can obstruct or block blood flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta, especially during exertion. HCM can also affect the mitral valve and lead to arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Symptoms can vary widely, from none to severe, and may include: shortness of breath (especially with exertion), chest pain or pressure (angina), fatigue, dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting (syncope), palpitations (sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeat), and swelling in ankles/feet/legs. Many individuals are undiagnosed. It's a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people, including athletes.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a family history of HCM or sudden cardiac death, or if you experience symptoms suggestive of HCM, consult a doctor (cardiologist, often one specializing in cardiomyopathies).

    "general_advice": "Hypocalcemia is a condition where the level of calcium in your blood is lower than normal. Calcium is essential for nerve function, muscle contraction, blood clotting, and bone health. The body tightly regulates calcium levels, primarily through parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. Causes of hypocalcemia include: 1) Hypoparathyroidism: Underactivity of the parathyroid glands (e.g., after neck surgery damaging parathyroids, autoimmune, genetic). PTH normally raises blood calcium. 2) Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption from the gut. 3) Chronic kidney disease: Kidneys are involved in activating vitamin D and regulating calcium/phosphate. 4) Magnesium deficiency: Low magnesium can impair PTH secretion and action. 5) Certain medications: e.g., bisphosphonates, cinacalcet, some diuretics, phosphate-containing laxatives/enemas. 6) Pancreatitis (acute): Calcium can be deposited in inflamed pancreatic tissue. 7) Massive blood transfusions (citrate in transfused blood can bind calcium). 8) Sepsis or critical illness. Mild hypocalcemia may be asymptomatic. As levels fall, symptoms can include: numbness or tingling in fingers, toes, and around the mouth (perioral paresthesia); muscle cramps or spasms (tetany); muscle weakness or twitching; fatigue; irritability; depression; anxiety; dry skin/brittle nails; and in severe cases, seizures, arrhythmias, or laryngospasm.",

Hyponatremia usually results from an excess of water in the body relative to sodium (dilutional hyponatremia), rather than a true sodium deficiency, though sodium loss can also contribute. Causes can be complex and include: 1) Excessive fluid intake (especially plain water, e.g., psychogenic polydipsia, or during prolonged endurance exercise without adequate electrolyte replacement). 2) Conditions causing impaired water excretion by kidneys: Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH - too much ADH causes water retention), heart failure, liver cirrhosis, kidney disease, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol deficiency). 3) Excessive sodium loss: From severe vomiting or diarrhea, profuse sweating (with water-only replacement), use of diuretic medications (especially thiazides), certain kidney diseases (salt-wasting nephropathies). 4) Certain medications (e.g., some antidepressants like SSRIs, carbamazepine, ecstasy). Mild, chronic hyponatremia may be asymptomatic or cause subtle symptoms like fatigue or mild cognitive impairment. As sodium levels fall or drop rapidly, symptoms become more severe (see emergency advice).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Hyponatremia is diagnosed with a blood test (serum sodium level).

    "general_advice": "Hypothyroidism is a common condition where the thyroid gland (located in the neck) does not produce enough thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) to meet the body's needs. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, affecting virtually every organ system. When thyroid hormone levels are low, the body's processes slow down. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas with sufficient iodine is Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland - see separate entry). Other causes include: treatment for hyperthyroidism (e.g., radioactive iodine therapy, thyroid surgery), certain medications (e.g., lithium, amiodarone), radiation therapy to the neck or head, pituitary gland disorders (secondary hypothyroidism - pituitary doesn't produce enough TSH to stimulate thyroid), congenital hypothyroidism (present at birth), and iodine deficiency (rare in developed countries). Symptoms often develop gradually and can be vague, including: fatigue, lethargy, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, unexplained weight gain (or difficulty losing weight), dry skin, hair loss or thinning/brittle hair, puffy face, hoarse voice, muscle aches/weakness/stiffness, joint pain/stiffness, heavy or irregular menstrual periods, depression, impaired memory or concentration ('brain fog'), slowed heart rate, and goiter (enlarged thyroid - can occur in some types).",

    "general_advice": "Idiopathic dysmenorrhea, more commonly known as primary dysmenorrhea, refers to painful menstrual periods (cramps) that occur in the absence of any identifiable underlying pelvic pathology (like endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, or PID). It's very common, especially in adolescents and young women. The pain is thought to be caused by excessive production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that cause uterine muscle contractions to help shed the uterine lining during menstruation. High levels of prostaglandins can cause strong, painful cramps. The pain typically begins just before or with the onset of menstrual bleeding and lasts for 1-3 days. It's often described as cramping or colicky pain in the lower abdomen, which may radiate to the lower back or thighs. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, or dizziness can sometimes accompany the pain.",

If untreated, ileus can lead to complications like bowel ischemia or perforation (rare).",
    "general_advice": "Ileus, often called paralytic ileus or adynamic ileus, is a condition in which there is a lack of normal intestinal motility (peristalsis - the coordinated muscle contractions that move contents through the digestive tract), leading to a functional obstruction of the bowel, without any actual physical blockage. This means food, fluid, and gas cannot pass through the intestines properly. Common causes include: 1) Abdominal surgery (postoperative ileus is very common and usually temporary). 2) Medications (e.g., opioids, anticholinergics, some anesthetics). 3) Infections or inflammation within the abdomen (e.g., peritonitis, pancreatitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, sepsis). 4) Electrolyte imbalances (especially low potassium - hypokalemia, or low magnesium). 5) Severe illness or trauma. 6) Intestinal ischemia (reduced blood flow to the intestines). 7) Spinal cord injury or certain neurological conditions. Symptoms include: abdominal bloating or distension, abdominal pain (can be diffuse and crampy, or sometimes absent if bowel is completely atonic), nausea, vomiting (may contain bile or fecal matter if prolonged), inability to pass stool or gas (obstipation), and absent or diminished bowel sounds on examination.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop symptoms of ileus, especially after surgery or if you have risk factors, consult your doctor or go to an emergency department.

    "general_advice": "Impetigo is a common and highly contagious bacterial skin infection that primarily affects infants and young children, but can occur at any age. It's usually caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* (staph) or *Streptococcus pyogenes* (strep) bacteria. There are two main types: 1) Non-bullous impetigo (most common): Starts as small red sores or blisters that quickly rupture, ooze fluid, and then form a characteristic honey-colored or yellowish-brown crust. Often occurs around the nose and mouth, but can appear anywhere on the body. Usually itchy but not painful. 2) Bullous impetigo: Less common, characterized by larger, fluid-filled blisters (bullae) that appear on the trunk, arms, or legs. The blisters are fragile and may rupture, leaving a moist, red base, then a thin, varnish-like crust. This form is almost always caused by staph bacteria that produce a toxin. Impetigo spreads easily through direct contact with sores or contaminated items (towels, clothing, toys).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect impetigo, see a doctor. Diagnosis is usually based on the appearance of the lesions.

Mifepristone blocks progesterone (needed for pregnancy to continue), and misoprostol causes uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. It's similar to an early miscarriage. 2) Surgical abortion: Different procedures are used depending on gestational age. Vacuum aspiration (suction curettage) is common in the first trimester. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) is typically used in the second trimester. These procedures are performed by trained healthcare providers in a clinical setting.

    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most cases of viral gastroenteritis are self-limiting and resolve with home care. However, see a doctor if symptoms are severe, if dehydration is suspected, if there's bloody diarrhea, high fever, or if symptoms persist for more than a few days, or if you are in a high-risk group. A doctor can help determine if it's viral or bacterial/parasitic (stool tests may be done) and whether specific treatment (like antibiotics for some bacterial infections) is needed. Antibiotics are not effective for viral gastroenteritis.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Prevent dehydration: This is the most important step. Drink plenty of clear fluids (water, oral rehydration solution - ORS like Pedialyte, diluted juice, clear broths, flat ginger ale). Sip frequently, especially after episodes of vomiting or diarrhea. Avoid sugary drinks (can worsen diarrhea), caffeine, and alcohol.",
      "Rest as much as possible.",
      "Gradual reintroduction of food: Once vomiting subsides, start with bland, easily digestible foods (BRAT diet - Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast; also crackers, plain potatoes, boiled chicken). Avoid fatty, spicy, or dairy foods initially.",
      "Over-the-counter medications: Antidiarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide - Imodium) may be used by adults for watery diarrhea if no fever or blood in stool, but use with caution and discuss with doctor first, as they can sometimes prolong bacterial infections. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) may help with nausea and diarrhea. Antiemetics for nausea (prescription or OTC like dimenhydrinate) may be used cautiously.",
      "Prevention of spread: Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, especially after using the toilet or changing diapers, and before preparing/eating food. Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces. Avoid preparing food for others if you are sick. Stay home from work/school until symptoms resolve."

    "general_advice": "An ingrown toenail (onychocryptosis) occurs when the corner or side of a toenail, usually on the big toe, grows into the soft flesh of the toe. This can cause pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes infection in the surrounding skin. Common causes include: cutting toenails too short or rounding the edges (nails should be cut straight across), wearing shoes that are too tight or narrow and crowd the toes, injury to the toenail (e.g., stubbing the toe), unusually curved toenails (pincer nails), or poor foot hygiene. If an infection develops, there may be pus drainage and increased pain/swelling.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If home care doesn't relieve symptoms within a few days, if pain is severe, or if there are signs of infection, consult a doctor or podiatrist. They can assess the ingrown toenail and may perform a minor procedure to lift or partially/fully remove the ingrown portion of the nail, often with local anesthesia. Antibiotics may be prescribed if infected.",

Signs include: sudden, severe pain in the hernia bulge that rapidly worsens; bulge becomes firm, tender, and cannot be reduced; nausea, vomiting; fever; inability to pass gas or have a bowel movement; or redness/discoloration over the bulge. Strangulation is a life-threatening emergency requiring urgent surgery.",
    "general_advice": "An inguinal hernia occurs when soft tissue, usually part of the intestine or fatty tissue, protrudes through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall muscles, into the inguinal canal in the groin area. In men, the inguinal canal is where the spermatic cord passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. Inguinal hernias are much more common in men than women. They can be present at birth (indirect inguinal hernia, due to a persistent opening in the abdominal wall) or develop later in life (direct inguinal hernia, due to weakening of abdominal muscles with age or strain). Symptoms include a visible bulge or lump in the groin or scrotum, which may become more noticeable when standing, coughing, or straining, and may disappear when lying down. There may be aching, pain, discomfort, pressure, or a heavy sensation in the groin, especially with activity. Some inguinal hernias cause no symptoms.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a bulge or lump in your groin, or experience groin pain or discomfort, consult your doctor. They can usually diagnose an inguinal hernia with a physical exam. While small, asymptomatic hernias may sometimes be monitored, surgical repair (herniorrhaphy, often done laparoscopically or open) is usually recommended to prevent complications like incarceration or strangulation, especially if the hernia is symptomatic or enlarging.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If you have an inguinal hernia that is not yet repaired:",
      "  - Avoid heavy lifting and straining, which can worsen the hernia or increase risk of complications.",

    "general_advice": "Insect bites and stings are common and usually cause only minor, localized reactions. Biting insects (e.g., mosquitoes, fleas, bed bugs, biting flies, chiggers) inject saliva that can cause itching, redness, and small bumps. Stinging insects (e.g., bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, fire ants) inject venom, which can cause immediate pain, redness, swelling, warmth, and itching at the sting site. Most reactions are mild and resolve within a few hours to days. However, some people can have more severe local reactions or life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to stings.

Prompt treatment is critical to prevent brain damage or death.",
    "general_advice": "Insulin overdose occurs when too much insulin is administered relative to the body's needs, leading to a dangerously low blood sugar level (severe hypoglycemia). Insulin is a hormone (either naturally produced or taken as medication) that helps glucose enter cells for energy, thereby lowering blood sugar. An overdose can happen accidentally (e.g., dosing error - taking wrong type or amount of insulin, injecting into muscle instead of fat causing rapid absorption, mistiming insulin with meals, unexpected decrease in food intake or increase in activity) or intentionally. People with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes using insulin are at risk. The brain relies heavily on glucose for fuel, so severe hypoglycemia can quickly lead to serious neurological consequences.",

    "general_advice": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a broad group of over 200 different disorders characterized by inflammation and/or scarring (fibrosis) of the interstitium, which is the tissue surrounding the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. This damage makes the lung tissue stiff and impairs the ability of oxygen to pass from the air sacs into the bloodstream. The causes of ILD are diverse and can include: 1) Known causes: Exposure to environmental or occupational irritants (e.g., asbestos - asbestosis, silica dust - silicosis, coal dust, bird/animal droppings - hypersensitivity pneumonitis), certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin, some chemotherapy drugs), radiation therapy to the chest, or autoimmune/connective tissue diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis). 2) Idiopathic (unknown cause): The most common of these is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and often fatal scarring lung disease. Other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) also exist. Common symptoms of ILD include: progressive shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with exertion; a persistent, dry, non-productive cough; fatigue; and sometimes chest discomfort or clubbing of the fingers/toes (in advanced stages).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent, unexplained shortness of breath or dry cough, consult your doctor (primary care or pulmonologist - lung specialist). Diagnosis can be complex and involves a medical history (including exposure history), physical exam, lung function tests (spirometry, diffusing capacity - DLCO), chest imaging (high-resolution CT scan - HRCT is key), blood tests (for autoimmune markers or specific exposures), and sometimes bronchoscopy with lavage or lung biopsy.",

    "general_advice": "Intestinal malabsorption is a condition where the small intestine is unable to properly absorb nutrients (such as fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals) from food. This can lead to various nutritional deficiencies and a range of symptoms. Causes of malabsorption are diverse and can involve problems with digestion (breakdown of food, e.g., pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid deficiency), absorption (damage to intestinal lining or reduced surface area, e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, tropical sprue, Whipple's disease, intestinal infections like Giardia), or transport of absorbed nutrients (e.g., lymphatic obstruction). Symptoms can include: chronic diarrhea (often pale, bulky, greasy, foul-smelling stools - steatorrhea, if fat malabsorption), unintentional weight loss or failure to thrive (in children), abdominal bloating, gas, cramping, fatigue, weakness, and specific symptoms related to nutrient deficiencies (e.g., anemia from iron/B12/folate deficiency, easy bruising from vitamin K deficiency, bone pain/fractures from calcium/vitamin D deficiency, night blindness from vitamin A deficiency, skin rashes, edema from protein deficiency).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent diarrhea, unexplained weight loss, abdominal discomfort, or symptoms of nutritional deficiencies, consult your doctor (primary care or gastroenterologist). Diagnosis involves a detailed history, physical exam, blood tests (for anemia, nutritional deficiencies, specific antibodies like in celiac disease), stool tests (for fat, parasites, pancreatic enzymes), imaging, endoscopy with biopsy, or specialized absorption tests (e.g., D-xylose test, breath tests for lactose/fructose intolerance or bacterial overgrowth).",

Complications include bowel ischemia (loss of blood supply), perforation (tear), and peritonitis.",
    "general_advice": "Intestinal obstruction (bowel obstruction) occurs when the normal passage of food, fluid, gas, and stool through the small or large intestine is blocked, either partially or completely. The blockage can be mechanical (a physical barrier) or functional (paralytic ileus - where intestinal motility stops, see separate entry). Common causes of mechanical small bowel obstruction include: adhesions (bands of scar tissue that form after abdominal or pelvic surgery - most common cause), hernias (inguinal, femoral, incisional - where intestine gets trapped), tumors (benign or malignant), Crohn's disease (causing strictures), intussusception (telescoping of one part of intestine into another, common in children), or volvulus (twisting of the intestine). Common causes of mechanical large bowel obstruction include: colorectal cancer, diverticulitis (causing strictures or abscesses), volvulus (sigmoid or cecal), fecal impaction, or strictures from IBD. Symptoms depend on the location and completeness of obstruction (see emergency advice).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if intestinal obstruction is suspected. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, abdominal X-rays (often show dilated loops of bowel and air-fluid levels), and usually a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis (to confirm obstruction, identify location, cause, and assess for complications like ischemia or perforation).",
    "self_care_tips": [

The bleeding damages brain cells in the area and can also cause surrounding brain tissue to swell (cerebral edema) and increase intracranial pressure, further damaging the brain. The most common cause of spontaneous ICH is chronic high blood pressure (hypertension), which weakens small arteries in the brain, making them prone to rupture. Other causes include: head trauma (traumatic ICH), ruptured cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), bleeding disorders or anticoagulant medication (blood thinners), brain tumors that bleed, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (a condition affecting blood vessels in the brain, common in elderly), or illicit drug use (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines). Symptoms depend on the location and size of the hemorrhage but often develop suddenly (see emergency advice).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical care in a hospital with stroke capabilities is essential.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent severe brain damage or death.",
    "general_advice": "An intracranial abscess, commonly a brain abscess, is a localized collection of pus within the brain tissue, surrounded by a capsule. It's caused by a bacterial or fungal infection. Infection can reach the brain through: 1) Direct spread from a nearby infection: e.g., sinusitis, otitis media (ear infection), mastoiditis, dental abscess. 2) Hematogenous spread (through bloodstream): From an infection elsewhere in the body (e.g., lung infection/abscess, endocarditis, skin infection). 3) Head trauma or neurosurgery: If microorganisms are introduced. Risk factors include conditions that weaken the immune system (e.g., HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs), congenital heart disease (with right-to-left shunts), or chronic infections. Symptoms can develop gradually or rapidly and depend on the abscess size, location, and causative organism (see emergency advice). Increased intracranial pressure is a major concern.",

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if an infant or child develops: sudden onset of intermittent, severe, colicky abdominal pain (child may draw knees to chest and cry out, then appear fine between episodes); vomiting (may become bilious/green); passage of 'currant jelly' stool (stool mixed with blood and mucus - a late sign); lethargy; or a palpable sausage-shaped mass in the abdomen. Untreated, it can lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.",
    "general_advice": "Intussusception is a serious condition in which one segment of the intestine 'telescopes' or slides into an adjacent segment, like parts of a collapsible telescope. This can block the passage of food and fluid through the intestine (bowel obstruction) and can also cut off the blood supply to the affected part of the intestine, leading to tissue death (ischemia, necrosis), perforation, and infection. Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children between 3 months and 3 years of age, though it can occur at any age (rare in adults, often with a lead point like a tumor). In most cases in children, the cause is unknown (idiopathic), but it can sometimes be associated with a viral infection, Meckel's diverticulum, polyp, tumor, or enlarged lymph nodes acting as a 'lead point' that gets pulled into the downstream bowel.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if intussusception is suspected. Diagnosis is often made with an abdominal ultrasound (may show a 'target sign' or 'pseudokidney sign') or sometimes a contrast enema (air or barium enema).",

    "general_advice": "Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia, occurring when the body doesn't have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Lack of iron leads to fewer and smaller red blood cells, resulting in reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Common causes include: 1) Blood loss: Chronic, slow blood loss is a frequent cause (e.g., from heavy menstrual periods, gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers, polyps, cancer, or NSAID use, or parasitic infections like hookworm). 2) Inadequate dietary iron intake: Especially in vegetarians/vegans if diet is not well-planned, or in individuals with poor nutrition. 3) Impaired iron absorption: Due to conditions like celiac disease, Crohn's disease, previous gastric surgery (e.g., gastric bypass), or H. pylori infection. 4) Increased iron demand: During periods of rapid growth (infancy, adolescence) or pregnancy. Symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia can be mild and develop gradually, or more pronounced if severe. They include: fatigue, weakness, pale skin and mucous membranes, shortness of breath (especially with exertion), dizziness or lightheadedness, headache, cold hands and feet, brittle nails, cracks at the corners of the mouth (angular cheilitis), sore or swollen tongue (glossitis), and sometimes pica (craving non-food items like ice, dirt, or starch).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent symptoms of anemia or have risk factors for iron deficiency, consult your doctor. Diagnosis involves a complete blood count (CBC - showing low hemoglobin, small/pale red cells - microcytic, hypochromic anemia) and iron studies (e.g., serum ferritin - low, serum iron - low, transferrin saturation - low, total iron-binding capacity - TIBC - high).

Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, but can cause side effects like constipation, nausea, or stomach upset; taking with a small amount of food or with vitamin C (e.g., orange juice - enhances absorption) may help. Iron can turn stools black. Keep iron supplements out of reach of children, as overdose is dangerous.",
      "  - Intravenous (IV) iron: May be given if oral iron is poorly tolerated or absorbed, or if iron deficiency is severe.",
      "  - Dietary sources of iron: Include iron-rich foods in your diet. Heme iron (better absorbed) is found in red meat, poultry, and fish. Non-heme iron is found in plant-based foods like beans, lentils, tofu, spinach, fortified cereals, and dried fruits. Eating non-heme iron sources with vitamin C-rich foods enhances absorption.",

    "emergency_advice": "Acute bowel ischemia is a life-threatening surgical emergency. Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience: sudden onset of severe, persistent abdominal pain (often out of proportion to physical exam findings, can be diffuse or localized); nausea, vomiting (may be bloody); bloody diarrhea or bright red blood per rectum; abdominal distension or tenderness; fever; or signs of shock (rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, confusion). Chronic ischemia may present more gradually but acute worsening is an emergency. Delay in treatment can lead to bowel infarction (death of bowel tissue), perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, and death.",
    "general_advice": "Bowel ischemia (intestinal ischemia or mesenteric ischemia) occurs when blood flow to the intestines (small or large bowel) is significantly reduced or blocked, depriving the intestinal tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This can be acute (sudden onset, rapidly progressive) or chronic (develops more gradually). Causes include: 1) Arterial embolism or thrombosis: A blood clot (embolus from heart, e.g., in atrial fibrillation; or thrombus forming on an atherosclerotic plaque) blocks a mesenteric artery supplying the intestine (most common cause of acute mesenteric ischemia). 2) Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI): Reduced blood flow due to low blood pressure or vasospasm (e.g., in shock, heart failure, sepsis, or with certain medications). 3) Mesenteric venous thrombosis: A blood clot in a mesenteric vein draining the intestine (less common). 4) Chronic mesenteric ischemia ('intestinal angina'): Gradual narrowing of mesenteric arteries due to atherosclerosis, causing abdominal pain after eating (when intestines need more blood for digestion), weight loss (fear of eating), and diarrhea. Acute ischemia can lead to infarction (tissue death) and gangrene of the bowel within hours.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if acute bowel ischemia is suspected. For chronic mesenteric ischemia symptoms, see your doctor promptly. Diagnosis of acute ischemia involves a high index of suspicion, CT angiography (CTA) or mesenteric angiography (key diagnostic tools), and sometimes exploratory laparotomy. Chronic ischemia may be diagnosed with CTA, MRA, or angiography.",

Call emergency services (911, 999, 112).",
    "general_advice": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is essentially the same as coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary atherosclerosis (see separate entry for Coronary Atherosclerosis). It refers to heart problems caused by narrowed or blocked coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle (myocardium). This narrowing (stenosis) is due to the buildup of atherosclerotic plaques. When blood flow is restricted, the heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen (ischemia), which can cause angina (chest pain or discomfort, especially during exertion or stress when oxygen demand is high). If a plaque ruptures and a blood clot completely blocks an artery, it can lead to a heart attack (myocardial infarction), where part of the heart muscle dies. Chronic IHD can also weaken the heart muscle over time, leading to heart failure or arrhythmias.",

This is to rule out underlying systemic diseases, severe skin conditions, or allergic reactions.",
    "general_advice": "Itching (pruritus) is an unpleasant sensation that provokes the desire to scratch. When the cause of persistent or widespread itching cannot be identified after a thorough medical evaluation, it may be termed pruritus of unknown origin or idiopathic pruritus. Many conditions can cause itching, including: dry skin (xerosis - very common), skin diseases (e.g., eczema, psoriasis, scabies, hives, fungal infections, contact dermatitis), internal/systemic diseases (e.g., liver disease/cholestasis, kidney failure/uremia, thyroid disorders - hyper or hypo, iron deficiency anemia, certain cancers like lymphoma or leukemia, polycythemia vera), nerve disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, shingles/postherpetic neuralgia, pinched nerves), psychiatric conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder - psychogenic itch), allergic reactions (to foods, drugs, insect bites), or pregnancy (e.g., PUPPP, cholestasis of pregnancy). When these are ruled out, the focus shifts to symptomatic relief.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent, severe, or unexplained itching, consult your doctor or dermatologist.

    "general_advice": "Jaw disorder is a broad term that can refer to various conditions affecting the jawbone (mandible or maxilla) and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which connects the lower jaw to the skull in front of the ears. Common jaw disorders include: 1) Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs or TMJ disorders): Problems with the jaw joint and the muscles that control jaw movement. Symptoms include jaw pain or tenderness (often worse with chewing, talking, or yawning), clicking, popping, or grating sounds in the TMJ, difficulty opening or closing the mouth fully, locking of the jaw, headaches, earaches, and facial pain. Causes can be multifactorial (e.g., arthritis in TMJ, jaw injury, teeth grinding/clenching - bruxism, stress, disc displacement in TMJ). 2) Dental problems: Toothache, dental abscesses, gum disease, malocclusion (misaligned bite) can cause jaw pain. 3) Jawbone issues: Osteomyelitis (bone infection), tumors (benign or malignant), cysts, or developmental abnormalities. 4) Neurological conditions: Trigeminal neuralgia (nerve pain). Symptoms vary widely based on the specific disorder.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent jaw pain, clicking, locking, difficulty opening/closing your mouth, or other bothersome jaw symptoms, consult your doctor or dentist. Depending on the suspected cause, you may be referred to a specialist like an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, TMJ specialist, orthodontist, neurologist, or ENT specialist.

    "general_advice": "Joint effusion refers to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in or around a joint, causing swelling. The fluid can be synovial fluid (normal joint lubricant, but increased in amount), blood (hemarthrosis - see separate entry), or pus (if infected). Joint effusion is a symptom, not a disease itself, and indicates an underlying problem with the joint. Common causes include: 1) Injury/Trauma: Sprains, ligament tears, meniscus tears, fractures extending into the joint. 2) Arthritis: Osteoarthritis (wear-and-tear), rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune), psoriatic arthritis, gout (urate crystal deposition), pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition). 3) Infection (septic arthritis): Bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of the joint. 4) Bursitis or tendinitis near the joint (can sometimes cause reactive effusion). 5) Overuse or repetitive stress. Symptoms, in addition to swelling, can include pain, stiffness, limited range of motion, warmth, and sometimes redness, depending on the cause. The knee is a common site for effusion ('water on the knee').",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have unexplained joint swelling, especially if it's painful, persistent, or limiting your function, consult your doctor (primary care, orthopedist, or rheumatologist). Diagnosis involves a physical exam, and often aspiration of the joint fluid (arthrocentesis) to analyze its content (e.g., for crystals, white blood cells, bacteria, blood), which can help determine the cause.

    "general_advice": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is the most common type of arthritis in children and adolescents (under age 16). It's an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, primarily the joints, causing inflammation, pain, swelling, stiffness (often worse in the morning or after rest), and limited range of motion. JIA is not a single disease but a group of chronic arthritic conditions. Types include: 1) Oligoarticular JIA (affects 4 or fewer joints, often larger ones like knees/ankles). 2) Polyarticular JIA (affects 5 or more joints, can be rheumatoid factor positive or negative, often affects small joints symmetrically). 3) Systemic JIA (Still's disease - characterized by arthritis, high spiking fevers, rash, and often internal organ involvement). 4) Psoriatic JIA (arthritis with psoriasis or family history). 5) Enthesitis-related JIA (inflammation where tendons/ligaments attach to bone - enthesitis, often involves spine/sacroiliac joints, similar to ankylosing spondylitis). 6) Undifferentiated JIA. JIA can also affect other parts of the body, such as the eyes (uveitis - inflammation of the uvea, can lead to vision loss if untreated, often asymptomatic initially), skin, and internal organs. The exact cause is unknown but involves genetic and environmental factors.",

Acute complications like massive hemorrhage from a tumor are rare but emergencies.",
    "general_advice": "Kidney cancer, also known as renal cancer, is cancer that originates in the kidneys, the two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine behind the abdominal organs, which filter waste from the blood and produce urine. The most common type of kidney cancer in adults is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which arises from the lining of the kidney tubules. Other less common types include transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carcinoma - affects renal pelvis or ureter, similar to bladder cancer), Wilms' tumor (most common kidney cancer in children), and renal sarcoma (rare). Early-stage kidney cancer often causes no symptoms and may be found incidentally during imaging tests done for other reasons. When symptoms do occur, the classic triad (though uncommon to see all three) includes: hematuria (blood in urine - can be visible or microscopic), flank pain (pain in the side between ribs and hip), and a palpable mass or lump in the abdomen or side. Other symptoms can include persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, fever not due to infection, anemia, and high blood pressure. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, family history of kidney cancer, certain genetic syndromes (e.g., von Hippel-Lindau disease), long-term dialysis, and occupational exposure to certain chemicals.",

    "general_advice": "Hypertensive nephropathy, also known as hypertensive kidney disease, is kidney damage caused by long-term, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension). Chronic high blood pressure damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. This damage impairs the kidneys' ability to filter properly, leading to a gradual loss of kidney function (chronic kidney disease - CKD) and an increase in protein (albumin) in the urine (proteinuria/albuminuria). Over time, this can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. Hypertensive nephropathy is a major cause of CKD, second only to diabetes. It often develops slowly and may be asymptomatic in its early stages. As kidney function declines, symptoms similar to other forms of CKD may appear: fatigue, swelling (edema), changes in urination, loss of appetite, nausea, itching, and difficulty concentrating.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have high blood pressure, regular monitoring of your kidney function by your doctor is crucial.

    "general_advice": "A kidney stone (renal calculus or nephrolith) is a hard, crystalline deposit that forms inside the kidneys when urine becomes too concentrated with certain minerals and salts (e.g., calcium, oxalate, uric acid, struvite - from infection). Stones can vary in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. They may remain in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract (ureter, bladder, urethra). Small stones may pass out of the body in urine without causing symptoms. However, larger stones can get stuck in the ureter, blocking urine flow and causing severe pain. The hallmark symptom is renal colic: sudden onset of excruciating, intermittent, sharp pain, usually in the flank (side between ribs and hip) or lower back, often radiating to the lower abdomen, groin, or genitals. Other symptoms can include: hematuria (pink, red, or brown urine), cloudy or foul-smelling urine, frequent or urgent need to urinate, painful urination (dysuria), nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever/chills if infection is present.

    "severity_level": "Medium",
    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention if a knee injury causes: severe pain and inability to bear any weight; obvious deformity of the knee (suspect dislocation or severe fracture); a loud 'pop' or 'snap' at the time of injury followed by rapid, significant swelling or instability; or if the knee locks, catches, or gives way repeatedly. Also, if there are signs of neurovascular compromise (numbness, tingling, coldness, paleness in lower leg/foot).",
    "general_advice": "Knee ligament and meniscus tears are common sports-related or traumatic injuries. Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect bones to each other and provide stability to the joint. The main knee ligaments are: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL - prevents tibia from sliding forward), Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL - prevents tibia from sliding backward), Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL - stabilizes inner knee), and Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL - stabilizes outer knee). Tears can range from mild (Grade I sprain) to complete rupture (Grade III). The menisci (medial and lateral) are C-shaped pieces of tough cartilage that act as shock absorbers and stabilizers between the femur (thighbone) and tibia (shinbone). Tears can occur from twisting injuries, forceful impact, or degeneration with age. Symptoms of ligament tears often include: a 'pop' at time of injury, immediate pain, rapid swelling, instability ('knee giving out'), and limited range of motion. Symptoms of meniscus tears can include: pain (especially with twisting or squatting), swelling, stiffness, locking or catching of the knee, a sensation of the knee giving way, and limited range of motion.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you sustain a knee injury with significant pain, swelling, instability, locking, or inability to bear weight, consult a doctor (primary care, sports medicine, or orthopedist). Diagnosis involves a physical exam (specific tests for ligament/meniscus integrity, e.g., Lachman's, McMurray's), and imaging (X-rays to rule out fracture; MRI is the best test to visualize ligament, meniscus, and cartilage tears).",

Sudden, severe vertigo with hearing loss needs prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the inner ear labyrinth, which houses the cochlea (responsible for hearing) and the vestibular system (responsible for balance). It's usually caused by a viral infection (often following a cold, flu, or other upper respiratory infection), but can sometimes be bacterial (e.g., spreading from a middle ear infection, though this is less common and more serious). Labyrinthitis typically causes a sudden onset of vertigo (a false sensation of spinning or whirling), dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and hearing loss (ranging from mild to profound) in the affected ear, often accompanied by tinnitus (ringing in the ear). Balance problems can be severe, making it difficult to stand or walk. Symptoms can last for several days to weeks, with gradual improvement, though some residual dizziness or hearing issues may persist longer in some cases.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience sudden vertigo, hearing loss, and other symptoms of labyrinthitis, consult your doctor (primary care, ENT specialist, or neurologist) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other serious conditions that can cause similar symptoms (e.g., stroke, Meniere's disease, brain tumor). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical symptoms and neurological/ear exam. Hearing tests (audiometry) will be done.",

  "lactose_intolerance": {
    "display_name": "Lactose Intolerance",
    "severity_level": "Low",
    "emergency_advice": null,
    "general_advice": "Lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to fully digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. This is due to a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is produced in the small intestine and is needed to break down lactose into simpler sugars (glucose and galactose) that can be absorbed. When undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, it's fermented by bacteria, producing gas and other substances that lead to symptoms. Symptoms typically occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming dairy and can include: abdominal bloating, gas (flatulence), diarrhea, abdominal cramps or pain, and sometimes nausea or rumbling sounds in the abdomen (borborygmi). The severity of symptoms often depends on the amount of lactose consumed and the degree of lactase deficiency. Lactose intolerance is not the same as a milk allergy (which involves an immune system reaction and can be life-threatening). Most lactose intolerance is primary lactase deficiency (genetically determined, lactase production declines after infancy/childhood - very common in many ethnic groups). Secondary lactase deficiency can occur due to damage to the small intestine (e.g., from infection, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, surgery). Congenital lactase deficiency (born without lactase) is very rare.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you frequently experience digestive symptoms after consuming dairy, consult your doctor to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions with similar symptoms (e.g., IBS, celiac disease, milk allergy). Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms after dairy intake, or with tests like a lactose tolerance test, hydrogen breath test, or stool acidity test (for infants/children).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management focuses on reducing symptoms by limiting lactose intake.",
      "  - Avoid or reduce consumption of lactose-containing dairy products (milk, ice cream, soft cheeses). Many people can tolerate small amounts of lactose without symptoms.",
      "  - Choose lactose-free milk and dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream where lactase enzyme has been added).",
      "  - Hard, aged cheeses (cheddar, Swiss, Parmesan) are often low in lactose and may be well-tolerated.",
      "  - Yogurt with live active cultures may be better tolerated as the bacteria help digest lactose.",
      "  - Read food labels carefully, as lactose can be a hidden ingredient in processed foods, baked goods, sauces, and medications.",
      "  - Lactase enzyme supplements (tablets or drops, e.g., Lactaid) can be taken just before consuming dairy products to help digest lactose. Effectiveness varies.",
      "  - Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake from non-dairy sources (e.g., leafy greens, fortified foods like orange juice/cereals, canned fish with bones, tofu) or supplements if dairy intake is significantly restricted. Discuss with your doctor or a dietitian.",

Also, if hoarseness is severe, sudden, or lasts more than 2-3 weeks, especially in smokers or if associated with a neck lump or other concerning symptoms (to rule out more serious conditions like laryngeal cancer).",
    "general_advice": "Laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx (voice box), usually caused by overuse, irritation, or infection of the vocal cords. The vocal cords are muscles within the larynx that vibrate to produce sound. When they are inflamed or swollen, it can cause hoarseness or loss of voice. Acute laryngitis (short-term) is most commonly caused by viral infections (like a cold or flu), vocal strain (from yelling, cheering, or talking/singing too much), or irritants (smoke, fumes). Chronic laryngitis (lasting more than 3 weeks) can be caused by long-term exposure to irritants, chronic sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD - stomach acid irritating larynx), smoking, excessive alcohol use, chronic vocal strain, or less commonly, more serious conditions like vocal cord nodules/polyps/cysts, or laryngeal cancer. Symptoms include: hoarseness, weak voice or voice loss (aphonia), raw or tickling sensation in the throat, sore throat, dry cough, and sometimes mild fever or difficulty swallowing if due to infection.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most acute viral laryngitis resolves on its own within a week or two. See a doctor if hoarseness is severe, lasts longer than 2-3 weeks, is accompanied by difficulty breathing/swallowing, severe pain, coughing up blood, or if you are a professional voice user and it's impacting your work. An ENT specialist may perform a laryngoscopy to visualize the vocal cords.",

    "general_advice": "Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is an overuse injury causing pain and tenderness on the outer part of the elbow, specifically at the lateral epicondyle (the bony bump on the outside of the elbow where forearm extensor tendons attach). It's a form of tendinopathy (tendon disorder), often involving inflammation (tendinitis) or degeneration (tendinosis) of the tendons that extend the wrist and fingers. Despite its name, it often occurs in people who don't play tennis, resulting from repetitive motions of the wrist and arm, such as those involved in painting, plumbing, carpentry, typing, using a screwdriver, or cutting up food. The pain is typically a dull ache or burning sensation on the outer elbow, which may radiate down the forearm. It's often worse with activities that involve gripping, twisting the forearm, or extending the wrist (e.g., shaking hands, turning a doorknob, lifting objects with palm down). Weakness in grip strength may also occur.",

Tumor lysis syndrome (a metabolic emergency that can occur with rapid cancer cell breakdown, especially at start of treatment for aggressive leukemias) also requires urgent care.",
    "general_advice": "Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow (the soft, spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made). It's characterized by the rapid production of abnormal white blood cells (leukemic cells). These abnormal cells are not fully developed and cannot function properly to fight infection. They also crowd out normal blood cells (red blood cells, healthy white blood cells, and platelets) in the bone marrow, leading to various symptoms. Leukemia is classified as acute (rapidly progressing) or chronic (slower progressing), and by the type of white blood cell affected (lymphocytic/lymphoblastic leukemia - affects lymphocytes, or myelogenous/myeloid leukemia - affects myeloid cells like granulocytes). Main types include: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL - common in children), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML - common in adults), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL - common in older adults), and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML - mainly adults). Symptoms can be vague and vary depending on type/stage but often include: fatigue, weakness, pale skin (anemia), frequent or severe infections (due to lack of healthy white cells), easy bruising or bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, gum bleeding, petechiae - tiny red spots on skin, due to low platelets), fever, night sweats, bone or joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen, and unintentional weight loss.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent, unexplained symptoms suggestive of leukemia, consult your doctor (primary care or hematologist/oncologist).

    "general_advice": "Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and one of the most common types of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. It's characterized by the abnormal buildup of protein deposits called Lewy bodies (alpha-synuclein protein) in nerve cells in the brain. These deposits affect brain regions involved in thinking, memory, movement, and behavior. LBD encompasses two related conditions: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD - where dementia develops more than a year after Parkinson's motor symptoms begin). Core clinical features of DLB include: 1) Fluctuating cognition: Significant variations in attention, alertness, and cognitive abilities, often from day to day or even hour to hour. 2) Recurrent visual hallucinations: Often well-formed and detailed (e.g., seeing people or animals that aren't there). 3) REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD): Acting out dreams during REM sleep (e.g., yelling, kicking, flailing). 4) Parkinsonism: Symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, such as slowness of movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, tremor (often less prominent than in Parkinson's disease), and shuffling gait. Other symptoms can include autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary problems), depression, anxiety, apathy, and extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications.",

    "general_advice": "Lice infestation, or pediculosis, is caused by tiny, wingless parasitic insects that feed on human blood. There are three types of lice that infest humans: 1) Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis): Most common, found on the scalp and hair of the head. They lay eggs (nits) that are firmly attached to hair shafts, often near the scalp. Spread by close head-to-head contact or sharing personal items like hats, combs, brushes, headphones, or bedding. Common in school-aged children. Main symptom is intense itching of the scalp. 2) Body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis): Live in clothing and bedding seams and move to the skin to feed. Associated with poor hygiene and crowded living conditions. Can transmit certain diseases (e.g., epidemic typhus, trench fever - rare in developed countries). Cause itching and rash on body. 3) Pubic lice (Pthirus pubis - 'crabs'): Found in pubic hair, but can also infest other coarse body hair (eyelashes, eyebrows, armpits, chest hair). Usually spread by sexual contact. Cause intense itching in the genital area. Visible lice or nits are the main sign.",

The exact cause is unknown, but it's thought to be an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks cells of the skin or mucous membranes. It's not contagious. 1) Skin lichen planus: Characterized by the '4 P's' - purple, polygonal (many-sided), pruritic (itchy), papules and plaques (small, flat-topped bumps that can merge). Often appears on wrists, forearms, ankles, lower back. Can be very itchy. May resolve on its own over months to years, but can recur. 2) Oral lichen planus: Can appear as lacy white streaks or patches (reticular pattern - most common, often asymptomatic), red, swollen areas (erythematous/atrophic), or painful open sores (erosive/ulcerative) on the inside of cheeks, gums, tongue, or lips. Erosive form can be very painful and affect eating. 3) Genital lichen planus: Can cause similar lesions on vulva, vagina, or penis. 4) Lichen planopilaris (scalp): Can cause inflammation, scaling, and permanent patchy hair loss. 5) Nail lichen planus: Can cause thinning, ridging, splitting, or loss of nails.

    "emergency_advice": "While not an emergency, seek medical attention if the affected skin shows signs of a severe secondary bacterial infection (e.g., spreading redness, warmth, pain, pus, fever), if itching is unbearable and not controlled by home care, or if the condition significantly impacts sleep or quality of life.",
    "general_advice": "Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), also known as neurodermatitis, is a chronic skin condition characterized by localized, intensely itchy patches of thickened, leathery, and often hyperpigmented (darkened) skin. It develops as a result of an 'itch-scratch cycle': an initial itch (which may be due to a minor irritant, insect bite, stress, or an underlying skin condition like eczema or psoriasis) leads to repeated rubbing, scratching, or picking of the area. This chronic trauma causes the skin to thicken (lichenification) and become even itchier, perpetuating the cycle. Common affected areas include the nape of the neck, scalp, ankles, wrists, forearms, genitals (scrotum, vulva), and inner thighs. The itching can be very intense and often worse at night or during times of stress or boredom.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a persistent, itchy, thickened patch of skin that doesn't improve with self-care, consult a doctor or dermatologist. They can diagnose LSC based on its appearance and history, and rule out other skin conditions. Treatment aims to break the itch-scratch cycle and reduce inflammation.",

This is to rule out other, more serious conditions like a liposarcoma (a rare malignant fatty tumor) or other soft tissue tumors.",
    "general_advice": "A lipoma is a common, benign (non-cancerous) tumor composed of mature fat cells (adipocytes). They typically present as soft, movable, painless lumps located just beneath the skin (subcutaneous). Lipomas can occur almost anywhere on the body but are most common on the trunk (back, chest, abdomen), neck, shoulders, upper arms, and thighs. They usually grow slowly and can vary in size from very small (less than 1 cm) to quite large (several centimeters or more). Most people with a lipoma have only one, but some can develop multiple lipomas (lipomatosis). The exact cause is often unknown, though there may be a genetic predisposition in some cases (e.g., familial multiple lipomatosis). Lipomas are generally harmless and do not turn into cancer.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you discover a new lump under your skin, it's always best to have it evaluated by a doctor (primary care or dermatologist) to confirm that it is a lipoma and not something more serious.

Tumor rupture with internal bleeding is a life-threatening emergency.",
    "general_advice": "Liver cancer is cancer that originates in the cells of the liver. The most common type of primary liver cancer (cancer that starts in the liver) in adults is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which arises from hepatocytes (the main type of liver cell). Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) is another type of primary liver cancer that starts in the bile ducts within or outside the liver. Metastatic liver cancer (cancer that has spread to the liver from another part of the body, e.g., colon, breast, lung) is actually more common than primary liver cancer. Risk factors for HCC are strongly linked to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, often caused by: chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hemochromatosis, and exposure to aflatoxins (toxins from certain molds). Early liver cancer often causes no symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms can include: unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, feeling very full after a small meal, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain or tenderness (especially in upper right quadrant), an enlarged liver or a lump felt below the right rib cage, abdominal swelling (ascites), jaundice, itching, pale stools, and dark urine. Fatigue and fever can also occur.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have risk factors for liver cancer (especially cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B/C) or experience persistent, unexplained symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care, gastroenterologist, or hepatologist). People with cirrhosis or chronic HBV are often enrolled in regular surveillance programs (e.g., ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein - AFP blood test every 6 months) to detect liver cancer early, when it's most treatable. Diagnosis involves imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI), AFP levels, and sometimes a liver biopsy.",

    "general_advice": "Liver disease is a broad term for any condition that damages the liver and impairs its ability to function. The liver performs many vital functions, including filtering toxins from the blood, producing bile for digestion, making proteins (like clotting factors and albumin), storing glucose, and metabolizing drugs. There are many types of liver disease, with diverse causes: 1) Infections: Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E). 2) Immune system abnormalities: Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). 3) Genetic factors: Hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. 4) Cancer: Liver cancer (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma), metastatic cancer to liver. 5) Toxins/Substances: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH - often related to obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol), drug-induced liver injury (DILI). 6) Other: Cirrhosis (late-stage scarring from chronic liver disease - see separate entry), Budd-Chiari syndrome (blocked hepatic veins). Symptoms vary greatly depending on the type and severity of liver disease, and may be absent in early stages. Common symptoms can include: fatigue, weakness, jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes), abdominal pain or discomfort (upper right), loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, itching (pruritus), easy bruising or bleeding, and swelling in legs (edema) or abdomen (ascites).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have risk factors for liver disease or experience persistent symptoms suggestive of liver problems, consult your doctor (primary care, gastroenterologist, or hepatologist). Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam, blood tests (liver function tests - LFTs/liver enzymes like ALT/AST, bilirubin, albumin, clotting tests; viral hepatitis serologies; autoantibodies; iron studies, etc.), imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI, FibroScan/elastography), and sometimes a liver biopsy.",

These could indicate a serious underlying condition like cauda equina syndrome, infection, tumor, or fracture.",
    "general_advice": "Lumbago is a general, somewhat outdated term for pain in the lumbar region (lower back). It's often used to describe non-specific low back pain, meaning the pain is not attributable to a clearly identifiable, specific underlying disease or structural abnormality (like a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, fracture, or tumor, though these can cause lumbago-like pain). Most low back pain is mechanical, meaning it arises from problems with the muscles, ligaments, joints (facet joints), or intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine. Common causes or contributing factors include: muscle or ligament strains (from improper lifting, sudden awkward movements, overuse), poor posture, deconditioning (weak core/back muscles), degenerative disc disease (see separate entry), osteoarthritis of the spine, or sometimes psychological stress. The pain can be dull, aching, or sharp, and may be localized or radiate slightly. It can be acute (short-term, <6 weeks), subacute (6-12 weeks), or chronic (>12 weeks).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most acute low back pain resolves on its own within a few days to weeks with self-care. However, see a doctor if: pain is severe, doesn't improve after a week or two of self-care, radiates down the leg (sciatica), is accompanied by weakness/numbness, or if you have any 'red flag' symptoms (see emergency advice).

    "general_advice": "Lung cancer is cancer that originates in the tissues of the lungs. It's a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. There are two main types: 1) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The most common type (about 80-85%), includes adenocarcinoma (often starts in outer parts of lung, common in non-smokers too), squamous cell carcinoma (often starts in central airways, linked to smoking), and large cell carcinoma. 2) Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC): Less common (about 10-15%), tends to grow and spread very quickly, strongly associated with smoking. Early lung cancer often causes no symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms can include: a persistent cough that doesn't go away or worsens, coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (hemoptysis), chest pain (often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing), shortness of breath, wheezing, hoarseness, recurrent lung infections (bronchitis, pneumonia), unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Symptoms of metastatic disease depend on where it spreads (e.g., bone pain, neurological symptoms if brain mets, jaundice if liver mets). The primary risk factor for lung cancer is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, certain occupational carcinogens, air pollution, and family history.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent respiratory symptoms or other concerning symptoms, especially if you are a current or former smoker, consult your doctor. Diagnosis involves imaging (chest X-ray, CT scan, PET scan), sputum cytology, bronchoscopy with biopsy, or needle biopsy of suspicious lung lesions or lymph nodes.

    "general_advice": "A pulmonary contusion, or lung contusion, is a bruise to the lung tissue caused by blunt trauma to the chest. The impact damages small blood vessels in the lung, leading to bleeding and fluid accumulation (edema) within the lung tissue and air sacs (alveoli). This interferes with normal gas exchange (oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal), potentially leading to hypoxia (low blood oxygen). Pulmonary contusions are common after significant chest trauma and are often associated with other injuries like rib fractures, flail chest, or pneumothorax. Symptoms may not be immediately apparent but often develop and worsen over the first 24-48 hours after injury (see emergency advice).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical evaluation is crucial after any significant blunt chest trauma, especially if respiratory symptoms are present or develop.

Early treatment is key to prevent late-stage complications.",
    "general_advice": "Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks (deer ticks - *Ixodes scapularis* in eastern/midwestern US, *Ixodes pacificus* in western US; *Ixodes ricinus* in Europe). It's caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi* (and sometimes other *Borrelia* species). Lyme disease can affect multiple body systems and occurs in stages if untreated: 1) Early localized stage (3-30 days after tick bite): Often begins with a characteristic erythema migrans (EM) rash - a 'bull's-eye' rash that expands over days (though not everyone gets this rash, or it may look different). Flu-like symptoms like fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle/joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes may also occur. 2) Early disseminated stage (days to weeks after bite if untreated): Bacteria can spread through bloodstream to other parts of body. Symptoms can include: multiple EM rashes, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis), meningitis, severe headaches/neck stiffness, pain/swelling in large joints (arthritis), heart palpitations or irregular heartbeat (Lyme carditis), dizziness, shortness of breath. 3) Late disseminated stage (months to years after bite if untreated): Can cause chronic arthritis (especially in knees), and neurological problems (e.g., neuropathy - numbness/tingling/pain in hands/feet, cognitive issues like memory/concentration problems - 'Lyme brain fog', encephalopathy).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop an EM rash, or experience flu-like symptoms, facial palsy, or joint pain after a tick bite or potential exposure in an endemic area, consult your doctor. Diagnosis in early stage is often clinical (based on EM rash and exposure history).

Also, if there's a sudden, significant increase in limb size or severe pain that is new or different.",
    "general_advice": "Lymphedema is a chronic condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of protein-rich lymphatic fluid in the interstitial tissues, causing swelling (edema), most commonly in an arm or leg, but can also affect other body parts like the head, neck, trunk, or genitals. It occurs when the lymphatic system is damaged or blocked, impairing its ability to drain lymph fluid properly. There are two main types: 1) Primary lymphedema: Caused by a congenital abnormality or malformation of the lymphatic system (rare, can be present at birth or develop later in life, e.g., Milroy's disease, Meige disease, lymphedema tarda). 2) Secondary lymphedema (more common): Results from damage or obstruction of the lymphatic system due to an identifiable cause, such as: cancer treatment (e.g., surgical removal of lymph nodes - lymphadenectomy, or radiation therapy, especially for breast cancer, melanoma, gynecological cancers, prostate cancer, lymphoma); infection (e.g., recurrent cellulitis, lymphatic filariasis - a parasitic infection common in tropical regions); trauma or injury to lymphatic vessels; obesity (can compress lymphatic pathways); chronic venous insufficiency; or prolonged immobility. Symptoms include swelling in the affected limb (can range from mild to severe and disfiguring), feeling of heaviness or tightness, aching or discomfort, restricted range of motion, recurrent skin infections (cellulitis), and skin changes over time (thickening, hardening - fibrosis, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, increased risk of skin breakdown). Lymphedema is a progressive condition if not managed.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice persistent swelling in a limb or other body part, especially if you have risk factors for lymphedema, consult your doctor. Early diagnosis and intervention by a lymphedema specialist (often a certified lymphedema therapist - CLT, physiatrist, or vascular specialist) can help manage the condition, reduce swelling, and prevent complications. Diagnosis is often clinical, but imaging (e.g., lymphoscintigraphy, MRI, ultrasound) may be used.",

    "general_advice": "Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by specific, more invasive serovars (L1, L2, L3) of the bacterium *Chlamydia trachomatis* (different from the serovars that cause common chlamydial genital infection). It's more common in tropical and subtropical regions but outbreaks have occurred in men who have sex with men (MSM) in developed countries. LGV occurs in stages: 1) Primary stage (3-30 days after exposure): A small, painless papule, pustule, or ulcer appears at the site of infection (genitals, rectum, or mouth/throat), often goes unnoticed and heals quickly. 2) Secondary stage (2-6 weeks later): Bacteria spread to regional lymph nodes, causing painful, swollen lymph nodes (inguinal lymphadenopathy or 'buboes') in the groin. These buboes can become matted together, form abscesses, and rupture, draining pus. If infection is rectal, it can cause proctocolitis (inflammation of rectum/colon) with symptoms like rectal pain, discharge, bleeding, tenesmus (feeling of incomplete defecation), and constipation. Systemic symptoms like fever, chills, malaise, and joint pain can also occur. 3) Late stage (if untreated): Can lead to chronic inflammation, scarring, strictures (narrowing) of the rectum or urethra, fistulas (abnormal tunnels), and chronic lymphatic obstruction causing genital elephantiasis (lymphedema).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop swollen, painful lymph nodes in the groin, genital or rectal sores, or symptoms of proctocolitis, especially if you have risk factors for STIs, consult your doctor or go to an STI clinic. Diagnosis can be challenging. Swabs or biopsies from lesions or lymph node aspirates can be tested for *C. trachomatis* using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), and serovar typing can confirm LGV. Blood tests for LGV antibodies may also be used. Treatment with antibiotics is necessary.",

    "general_advice": "Lymphoma is a type of cancer that begins in lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system. Lymphocytes are found in lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and other parts of the body. There are two main categories of lymphoma: 1) Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, formerly Hodgkin's disease): Characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells (abnormal giant cells). Often starts in lymph nodes in the upper body (neck, chest, armpits) and tends to spread in an orderly fashion from one lymph node group to the next. More common in young adults and older adults. Generally has a good prognosis with treatment. 2) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL): A diverse group of many different subtypes of lymphoma, arising from B-lymphocytes (most common) or T-lymphocytes. NHL is more common than HL and can occur at any age. Some NHL subtypes are indolent (slow-growing), while others are aggressive (fast-growing). Symptoms of lymphoma can include: painless swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin; persistent fatigue; fever (often unexplained and recurrent); drenching night sweats; unexplained weight loss ('B-symptoms' - fever, night sweats, weight loss, common in HL and some aggressive NHLs); itchy skin (pruritus); shortness of breath or cough (if chest lymph nodes or lungs are involved); abdominal pain or swelling (if abdominal lymph nodes or spleen/liver are enlarged).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent, unexplained swollen lymph nodes or other symptoms suggestive of lymphoma, consult your doctor.

    "general_advice": "Macular degeneration, most commonly Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in older adults (usually over 60). It affects the macula, the small central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision needed for tasks like reading, driving, and recognizing faces. AMD does not cause total blindness, as peripheral (side) vision usually remains intact. There are two main types: 1) Dry AMD (atrophic AMD - most common): Characterized by the gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells in the macula and the accumulation of yellowish deposits called drusen under the retina. Vision loss is usually slow and progressive. 2) Wet AMD (neovascular or exudative AMD - less common but more severe): Characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile new blood vessels under the macula (choroidal neovascularization - CNV). These vessels can leak fluid or blood, causing rapid and severe damage to the macula and leading to more sudden and significant central vision loss or distortion. Dry AMD can sometimes progress to wet AMD. Symptoms of AMD can include: blurred or distorted central vision (straight lines may appear wavy - metamorphopsia), a dark or empty area (scotoma) in the center of vision, difficulty seeing fine details, reduced color perception, and needing brighter light for reading.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Regular comprehensive dilated eye exams with an ophthalmologist are crucial for early detection, especially for those over 50 or with risk factors (age, family history, smoking, Caucasian race, cardiovascular disease, poor diet). If you notice any changes in your central vision, see an ophthalmologist promptly. Diagnosis involves visual acuity testing, Amsler grid test (to detect distortion), dilated eye exam to view macula, optical coherence tomography (OCT - to visualize retinal layers and fluid), and sometimes fluorescein angiography (to look for leaky blood vessels in wet AMD).",

    "general_advice": "Magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) occurs when the level of magnesium in the blood is lower than normal. Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions in the body, including muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, blood pressure regulation, energy production, and protein synthesis. Causes of magnesium deficiency can include: 1) Inadequate dietary intake (less common as sole cause in healthy individuals, as magnesium is found in many foods like green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans). 2) Decreased absorption from the GI tract: e.g., due to Crohn's disease, celiac disease, chronic diarrhea, laxative abuse, or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use (long-term). 3) Increased losses: Through the kidneys (e.g., from diuretic use, certain kidney diseases, uncontrolled diabetes, alcoholism) or GI tract (vomiting, diarrhea, nasogastric suction). 4) Certain medications (e.g., diuretics, PPIs, amphotericin B, cisplatin). Mild deficiency may be asymptomatic or cause vague symptoms like fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting. As it worsens, symptoms can include: muscle cramps, spasms, or tremors; numbness or tingling; personality changes (irritability, apathy, depression, anxiety); abnormal heart rhythms; and it can also affect calcium and potassium levels, leading to hypocalcemia and hypokalemia.",

These are serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital (present at birth) abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring in about 2% of the population. It's a small pouch or bulge that forms on the wall of the small intestine (usually the ileum), representing a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct (vitelline duct) from fetal development. Most people with a Meckel's diverticulum have no symptoms and are unaware of it throughout their lives ('Rule of 2s' is a mnemonic for some features: 2% prevalence, often within 2 feet of ileocecal valve, about 2 inches long, often symptomatic by age 2, 2 types of ectopic tissue). However, complications can occur, more commonly in children (especially under age 2) than adults. Complications arise if the diverticulum contains ectopic (abnormally located) tissue, most often gastric (stomach) mucosa, which can secrete acid and cause ulceration and bleeding, or pancreatic tissue. Complications include: 1) Bleeding: Painless rectal bleeding (most common complication in children). 2) Diverticulitis: Inflammation or infection of the diverticulum, causing abdominal pain (often mimicking appendicitis), fever, nausea, vomiting. 3) Intestinal obstruction: The diverticulum can act as a lead point for intussusception, volvulus (twisting), or become trapped in a hernia. 4) Perforation: Rupture of the diverticulum (e.g., from diverticulitis or ulceration) leading to peritonitis.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If symptoms suggestive of a Meckel's diverticulum complication occur, prompt medical evaluation is needed. Diagnosis can be challenging. A Meckel's scan (technetium-99m pertechnetate scan) can help detect ectopic gastric mucosa. CT scan, ultrasound, or endoscopy/capsule endoscopy may sometimes be used, but often the diagnosis is made during surgery for complications.",

    "emergency_advice": "While melanoma itself usually doesn't cause acute emergencies unless very advanced or with specific complications (e.g., bleeding from an ulcerated tumor, acute neurological symptoms from brain metastasis), any suspicious skin lesion that is new, changing rapidly, bleeding, or fits the ABCDE criteria (see below) should be evaluated by a dermatologist promptly. Early detection and treatment are crucial for a good prognosis.",
    "general_advice": "Melanoma is the most serious and potentially life-threatening type of skin cancer. It develops in melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin (the pigment that gives skin its color). Melanoma can arise from an existing mole or appear as a new lesion on previously normal skin. It can occur anywhere on the body, including areas not typically exposed to sun (e.g., soles of feet, palms, under nails - acral lentiginous melanoma; or in mucous membranes or eyes - rare). While less common than other skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma), melanoma is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body (e.g., lymph nodes, liver, lungs, brain) if not detected and treated early. The main risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds. Other risk factors include: having many moles or atypical moles (dysplastic nevi), fair skin that burns easily, history of severe sunburns (especially in childhood), family history of melanoma, personal history of melanoma or other skin cancers, and weakened immune system. The ABCDE rule helps identify warning signs: Asymmetry (one half doesn't match other), Border irregularity (edges are ragged, notched, blurred), Color variation (uneven color - shades of brown, black, tan, sometimes white, red, blue), Diameter (larger than 6mm - about size of pencil eraser, though can be smaller), Evolving (mole is changing in size, shape, color, elevation, or new symptoms like itching/bleeding).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice any new skin lesion, a mole that changes in appearance, or a spot that fits the ABCDE criteria, consult a dermatologist immediately. Diagnosis involves a skin exam and a biopsy of the suspicious lesion. If melanoma is confirmed, staging (determining thickness, ulceration, spread to lymph nodes or distant sites) is done to guide treatment.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment depends on the stage of melanoma and may include:",
      "  - Surgical excision: Primary treatment for localized melanoma, removing the tumor and a margin of surrounding healthy skin.",
      "  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy: May be done to check if cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.",
      "  - For advanced or metastatic melanoma: Immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors - very effective for many), targeted therapy (if specific gene mutations like BRAF are present), chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.",
      "Prevention and early detection are key:",
      "  - Protect your skin from UV radiation: Seek shade, wear sun-protective clothing (hats, sunglasses), use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+) daily, avoid tanning beds.",
      "  - Perform regular skin self-exams (e.g., monthly) to look for new or changing moles/lesions.",
      "  - Have regular professional skin exams by a dermatologist, especially if you are at high risk.",

Seek medical attention if vertigo is very severe, prolonged, or associated with new or worsening neurological symptoms (to rule out other causes). If 'drop attacks' (Tumarkin's otolithic crisis - sudden falls without loss of consciousness, rare) occur, this poses a significant safety risk and needs evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo (a false sensation of spinning or whirling), fluctuating hearing loss (often low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss that can become permanent over time), tinnitus (ringing, roaring, or buzzing in the ear), and a feeling of fullness or pressure in the affected ear (aural fullness). It usually affects only one ear, but can become bilateral over time in some individuals. Meniere's disease is thought to be caused by an abnormal buildup of fluid (endolymph) in the inner ear labyrinth (endolymphatic hydrops), though the exact reason for this fluid buildup is often unknown. Attacks can occur suddenly, last from 20 minutes to several hours (sometimes up to 24 hours), and vary in frequency and severity. Between attacks, symptoms may resolve completely, or some degree of hearing loss or tinnitus may persist. The course of the disease is unpredictable.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience recurrent episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, consult a doctor (ENT specialist or neurologist/neurotologist).

These can indicate rapid tumor growth, bleeding into the tumor, or increased intracranial pressure requiring urgent intervention.",
    "general_advice": "A meningioma is a type of primary tumor that arises from the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Most meningiomas (about 80-90%) are benign (non-cancerous, WHO Grade I) and slow-growing. However, some can be atypical (WHO Grade II - more aggressive, higher recurrence risk) or malignant (WHO Grade III - cancerous, rare, invasive, high recurrence). Even benign meningiomas can cause serious problems if they grow large and press on adjacent brain tissue, nerves, or blood vessels, or if they are located in critical areas. They are more common in women and older adults. Risk factors include previous radiation therapy to the head and certain genetic conditions (e.g., neurofibromatosis type 2). Many small meningiomas are asymptomatic and found incidentally on brain imaging done for other reasons. When symptoms do occur, they depend on the tumor's size and location and can include: headaches (often worse in morning), seizures (common presenting symptom), weakness or numbness in limbs, vision problems (blurring, double vision, loss of peripheral vision), hearing loss or ringing in ears, dizziness or balance problems, speech difficulties, personality or cognitive changes, or loss of smell.",

    "general_advice": "Menopause is a natural biological process that marks the end of a woman's menstrual cycles and reproductive years. It's officially diagnosed after a woman has gone 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period. It typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, with the average age being around 51 in most Western countries. Menopause is caused by the natural decline in the production of reproductive hormones, primarily estrogen and progesterone, by the ovaries. The period leading up to menopause is called perimenopause, during which hormone levels fluctuate, and many women start experiencing menopausal symptoms. Common symptoms of menopause and perimenopause include: irregular periods (shorter/longer cycles, heavier/lighter flow, skipped periods leading up to final cessation), hot flashes (sudden feeling of warmth, often with flushing and sweating), night sweats, sleep disturbances (insomnia), vaginal dryness and discomfort (atrophic vaginitis - can cause pain during intercourse), mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression), difficulty concentrating or memory problems ('brain fog'), decreased libido, fatigue, joint pain, and changes in hair and skin.

These disorders can affect how the body processes carbohydrates, proteins, fats (lipids), or nucleic acids. There are many types of metabolic disorders, which can be: 1) Inherited/Genetic (Inborn Errors of Metabolism - IEMs): Caused by defects in specific genes that code for enzymes or proteins involved in metabolic pathways. Examples include phenylketonuria (PKU), galactosemia, Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease, mitochondrial disorders, urea cycle disorders, organic acidemias, and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Many IEMs are detected by newborn screening. 2) Acquired: Develop later in life due to various factors. Common examples include: Diabetes mellitus (Type 1 and Type 2 - affect glucose metabolism), Metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, abnormal cholesterol/triglycerides - increases risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes), Gout (uric acid metabolism), Thyroid disorders (affect overall metabolism), Obesity, Dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid levels), Osteoporosis (bone metabolism), and disorders of electrolyte or acid-base balance.

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention for acute, severe complications related to metastatic cancer or its treatment: uncontrolled pain; sudden, severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; new or worsening neurological symptoms (e.g., severe headache, seizures, confusion, weakness, paralysis - could be brain metastases or spinal cord compression); pathological fractures (bones breaking with minimal trauma); signs of hypercalcemia (if bone mets); severe infection (if immunocompromised); or severe side effects from cancer treatment.",
    "general_advice": "Metastatic cancer, also known as Stage IV cancer or advanced cancer, is cancer that has spread from its original (primary) site where it started to other, distant parts of the body. Cancer cells can break away from the primary tumor, travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, and form new tumors (metastases or secondary tumors) in other organs or tissues. Common sites of metastasis include the bones, liver, lungs, brain, and lymph nodes, though cancer can spread almost anywhere. Metastatic cancer is generally considered advanced and is often more difficult to treat than localized cancer, though treatment can still help control its growth, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life. Symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on the location and size of the metastases. General symptoms can include fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and loss of appetite. Site-specific symptoms can include: bone pain or fractures (bone mets); jaundice, abdominal pain/swelling, nausea (liver mets); cough, shortness of breath, chest pain (lung mets); headache, seizures, neurological deficits (brain mets).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a history of cancer and develop new, persistent, or concerning symptoms, report them to your oncologist promptly. Metastatic disease may be found during initial cancer staging or may develop later as a recurrence.

    "general_advice": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, moderate to severe headaches, often accompanied by other symptoms. Migraine headaches are typically throbbing or pulsating, often unilateral (affecting one side of the head, though can be bilateral), and can last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. They are often aggravated by physical activity. Associated symptoms can include: nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light (photophobia), sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), and sometimes sensitivity to smells (osmophobia). About 20-30% of people with migraine experience an aura, which is a reversible neurological symptom that usually precedes or accompanies the headache. Auras are most commonly visual (e.g., seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, blind spots) but can also be sensory (tingling, numbness) or motor (weakness). The exact cause of migraine is not fully understood but involves complex interactions of genetic, neurological, and environmental factors, likely involving changes in brain activity, blood vessels, and neurochemicals like serotonin and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide). Common triggers can include stress, hormonal changes (in women, e.g., around menstruation), changes in sleep patterns, certain foods or drinks (e.g., aged cheese, processed meats, chocolate, caffeine withdrawal, alcohol - especially red wine), weather changes, strong smells, or bright lights.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have frequent or severe headaches that you suspect might be migraines, or if your headache pattern changes, consult your doctor (primary care or neurologist).

These could indicate an incomplete miscarriage with retained tissue, infection, or other complications.",
    "general_advice": "A missed abortion, also known as a missed miscarriage or silent miscarriage, is a type of early pregnancy loss where the embryo or fetus has died, but the body has not yet expelled the pregnancy tissue (no uterine cramping or bleeding has occurred to signal the loss). The woman may still have pregnancy symptoms initially, or symptoms may have subsided, but often she is unaware that the pregnancy is no longer viable until it's discovered during a routine prenatal visit, often via ultrasound showing no fetal heartbeat or an empty gestational sac. Missed miscarriages usually occur in the first trimester. The cause is often due to chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo, making it incompatible with life. Other factors can sometimes play a role.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a missed miscarriage is diagnosed by your doctor (usually via ultrasound), they will discuss management options with you. It's important to have medical follow-up to ensure all pregnancy tissue is passed to prevent complications like infection or prolonged bleeding.",

      "  - Surgical management: Dilation and curettage (D&C) or dilation and evacuation (D&E) - a procedure to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This is often done if expectant or medical management fails, if there's heavy bleeding, signs of infection, or by patient preference.",
      "Physical recovery: Expect some bleeding and cramping, similar to a heavy period, which should gradually lessen. Use pads, not tampons. Avoid intercourse and douching until cleared by your doctor.",
      "Emotional recovery: A miscarriage, even if early or 'missed,' can be a significant emotional loss. Allow yourself time to grieve. Seek support from your partner, family, friends, support groups (for pregnancy loss), or a counselor. It's a common experience, and you are not alone.",

These can indicate acute heart failure, severe arrhythmia, or other critical complications of mitral valve disease.",
    "general_advice": "Mitral valve disease refers to conditions affecting the mitral valve, one of the four heart valves, located between the left atrium (upper left chamber) and the left ventricle (lower left main pumping chamber). The mitral valve has two leaflets (cusps) that open to allow blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle, and close to prevent blood from flowing backward. Mitral valve disease can be: 1) Mitral valve stenosis: The valve leaflets become stiff, thickened, or fused, narrowing the valve opening and restricting blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Common cause is rheumatic heart disease (from previous rheumatic fever). 2) Mitral valve regurgitation (insufficiency or incompetence): The valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to leak backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium when the ventricle contracts. Common causes include mitral valve prolapse (see below), damage from heart attack, rheumatic heart disease, endocarditis, or cardiomyopathy. 3) Mitral valve prolapse (MVP): The valve leaflets bulge (prolapse) back into the left atrium during contraction. Often benign and asymptomatic, but can sometimes lead to significant regurgitation or arrhythmias. Symptoms of mitral valve disease can vary from none (in mild cases) to severe, and may include: fatigue, shortness of breath (especially with exertion or when lying down), palpitations or irregular heartbeat (e.g., atrial fibrillation is common with mitral valve disease), cough, chest discomfort or pain, and swelling in ankles/feet (if heart failure develops).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of mitral valve disease, or if a heart murmur is detected, consult your doctor (primary care or cardiologist). Diagnosis involves a physical exam, EKG, and echocardiogram (key diagnostic tool to visualize the valve, assess its function, and quantify stenosis/regurgitation). Chest X-ray or cardiac catheterization may also be used.",

      "  - Surgical or catheter-based interventions (if disease is severe, symptomatic, or causing heart dysfunction):",
      "    - Mitral valve repair: Preferred option if feasible, to preserve the native valve. Various repair techniques exist.",
      "    - Mitral valve replacement: If repair is not possible, the damaged valve is replaced with a mechanical or biological (tissue) valve.",
      "    - Percutaneous mitral valve interventions (e.g., MitraClip for regurgitation, balloon valvuloplasty for stenosis) are less invasive options for some patients.",
      "Lifestyle modifications: Heart-healthy diet (low sodium if heart failure), regular moderate exercise (as approved), smoking cessation, limit alcohol.",

This is to rule out more serious conditions like appendicitis, ovarian cyst rupture or torsion, ectopic pregnancy, or pelvic inflammatory disease.",
    "general_advice": "Mittelschmerz (German for 'middle pain') is a term used to describe one-sided, lower abdominal or pelvic pain that some women experience around the time of ovulation, which typically occurs about midway through the menstrual cycle (roughly 14 days before the next period). The pain is thought to be caused by the stretching of the ovarian follicle as the egg matures, or by the release of follicular fluid or a small amount of blood from the ruptured follicle into the abdominal cavity, which can irritate the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen). The pain can vary from a mild twinge or dull ache to a sharp, cramp-like pain. It usually occurs on one side (the side of the ovulating ovary, which can alternate from month to month) and typically lasts from a few minutes to a few hours, but can sometimes persist for a day or two. Some women may also notice light vaginal spotting or discharge.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience mid-cycle pain that is new, severe, or concerning, it's a good idea to see your doctor or gynecologist to confirm it's likely Mittelschmerz and to rule out other pelvic conditions. If it's a recurring, predictable pattern of mild to moderate mid-cycle pain that resolves on its own, medical evaluation may not always be necessary, but it's still wise to mention it at your regular check-ups.",

    "general_advice": "Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral skin infection caused by a poxvirus (molluscum contagiosum virus - MCV). It results in small, raised, firm, flesh-colored or pearly-white bumps (papules) on the skin, often with a characteristic central dimple or indentation (umbilication). The lesions are usually painless but can sometimes be itchy, red, swollen, or tender, especially if they become inflamed or secondarily infected from scratching. Molluscum is contagious and spreads through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or by touching contaminated objects (fomites) like towels, clothing, toys, or shared sports equipment (e.g., wrestling mats). Autoinoculation (spreading to other parts of one's own body by scratching or touching lesions) is also common. It most frequently affects children (especially those with atopic dermatitis/eczema, as their skin barrier may be compromised), but can also occur in adolescents and adults (sometimes as an STI if lesions are in genital area). In immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS), lesions can be more numerous, larger, and persistent.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops bumps suggestive of molluscum contagiosum, consult a doctor or dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and discuss management options. In healthy individuals, molluscum is usually self-limiting and will eventually resolve on its own without treatment, but this can take several months to a year or even longer, and new lesions can appear during this time. Treatment may be considered if lesions are bothersome, numerous, causing cosmetic concern, or to prevent spread, especially in certain situations (e.g., extensive lesions, genital lesions, eczema).",

This can result in pain, numbness, tingling (paresthesia), weakness, or loss of function in the specific area of the body supplied by that nerve. Mononeuritis multiplex is a related condition where multiple, individual peripheral nerves are affected in different parts of the body simultaneously or sequentially. Causes of mononeuritis are diverse and can include: 1) Trauma or injury: Direct blow, compression, stretching, or cutting of a nerve. 2) Entrapment/Compression: Chronic pressure on a nerve as it passes through a narrow anatomical space (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome - median nerve at wrist; cubital tunnel syndrome - ulnar nerve at elbow; peroneal nerve palsy - at fibular head near knee). 3) Systemic diseases: Diabetes mellitus (can cause various mononeuropathies), vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels supplying nerves, common cause of mononeuritis multiplex), autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), infections (e.g., Lyme disease, leprosy, HIV, herpes zoster - shingles can cause postherpetic neuralgia which is a type of mononeuropathy), thyroid disorders, or kidney disease. 4) Tumors or cysts pressing on a nerve. 5) Exposure to toxins or certain medications. Symptoms are specific to the nerve involved (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome: pain/numbness/tingling in thumb, index, middle, and part of ring finger, hand weakness; peroneal nerve palsy: foot drop, weakness in foot/ankle dorsiflexion and eversion, numbness on top of foot/outer leg).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness localized to the distribution of a single nerve, consult your doctor (primary care, neurologist, or orthopedist/hand specialist depending on location).

    "general_advice": "Infectious mononucleosis (mono), often called the 'kissing disease' or glandular fever, is a contagious viral illness most commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a type of herpes virus. It can also be caused by other viruses like cytomegalovirus (CMV). EBV is very common, and many people are infected in childhood with mild or no symptoms. When infection occurs in adolescence or young adulthood, it's more likely to cause symptomatic mono. The virus spreads primarily through saliva (hence 'kissing disease'), but also by sharing drinks, utensils, or through respiratory droplets. Symptoms typically develop 4-6 weeks after infection and can include: extreme fatigue (can last for weeks or months), fever, sore throat (often severe, may have white patches on tonsils), swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy, especially in the neck, armpits, groin), headache, muscle aches, and sometimes a skin rash or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) or liver (hepatitis).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of mono, consult your doctor. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical exam.

These can indicate acute ischemia or hemorrhage related to moyamoya disease.",
    "general_advice": "Moyamoya disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder characterized by stenosis (narrowing) or occlusion (blockage) of the internal carotid arteries (major arteries supplying blood to the brain) at the base of the brain, and the formation of a collateral network of tiny, fragile blood vessels ('moyamoya' means 'puff of smoke' in Japanese, describing the appearance of these collaterals on angiography) to try and compensate for the reduced blood flow. This abnormal vascular network is prone to bleeding, and the narrowed main arteries reduce blood supply, increasing the risk of ischemic strokes (due to lack of blood flow) and hemorrhagic strokes (due to bleeding from fragile collaterals or aneurysms that can form). Moyamoya disease can affect children and adults. In children, it often presents with ischemic symptoms (TIAs, strokes, seizures, headaches, developmental delays, involuntary movements). In adults, hemorrhagic stroke is more common, but ischemic events can also occur. The exact cause is often unknown (idiopathic), but there's a higher prevalence in East Asian populations, and genetic factors are thought to play a role. It can also be associated with certain conditions (moyamoya syndrome - e.g., Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, sickle cell disease, previous radiation therapy to head).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child experiences symptoms suggestive of stroke, TIA, or other neurological problems consistent with moyamoya, consult a neurologist or neurosurgeon specializing in cerebrovascular disorders. Diagnosis involves brain imaging: MRI and MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) are key. Cerebral angiography (catheter-based) is the gold standard for visualizing the blood vessels. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and perfusion imaging (e.g., SPECT, PET) may also be used.",

    "general_advice": "Mucositis is a painful inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract, most commonly affecting the mouth (oral mucositis or stomatitis), but can also involve the esophagus, stomach, intestines, and rectum. It's a common and often debilitating side effect of cancer treatments, particularly chemotherapy (especially certain agents like 5-FU, methotrexate) and radiation therapy to the head, neck, or pelvic area. These treatments damage rapidly dividing cells, including those lining the GI tract. Symptoms of oral mucositis can range from mild redness and soreness to severe, painful ulcers that make eating, drinking, swallowing, and talking difficult. It can also cause dry mouth, altered taste, and increased risk of oral infections (bacterial, fungal, viral). Gastrointestinal mucositis can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and malabsorption.",

While MS itself is chronic, acute relapses or complications need prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often progressive, autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, the protective covering around nerve fibers. This damage (demyelination) disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses, leading to a wide range of neurological symptoms. Scar tissue (sclerosis or lesions/plaques) can form in areas of damage. The course of MS is highly variable and unpredictable. Common types include: Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS - most common, characterized by periods of new or worsening symptoms/relapses, followed by periods of partial or complete recovery/remission), Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS - often develops after a period of RRMS, with more steady worsening of disability, with or without relapses), and Primary Progressive MS (PPMS - characterized by gradually worsening symptoms from onset, without distinct relapses). Symptoms depend on the location and extent of nerve damage and can include: fatigue (very common and often debilitating), numbness or tingling (paresthesias), weakness in limbs, vision problems (e.g., optic neuritis - painful vision loss/blurring in one eye, double vision - diplopia, nystagmus - involuntary eye movements), dizziness or vertigo, balance problems and difficulty walking (ataxia), spasticity (muscle stiffness/spasms), pain (neuropathic or musculoskeletal), bladder and bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, cognitive impairment ('cog fog' - memory, attention, processing speed problems), and mood changes (depression, anxiety).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience unexplained neurological symptoms suggestive of MS, consult a doctor (neurologist, often one specializing in MS). Diagnosis involves a medical history, neurological exam, MRI of the brain and spinal cord (to look for characteristic lesions), evoked potential studies (to measure nerve signal speed), and sometimes analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF via lumbar puncture - may show oligoclonal bands). Diagnosis requires evidence of demyelination disseminated in time and space, and ruling out other conditions.",

These complications are more common in unvaccinated individuals or adults.",
    "general_advice": "Mumps is a contagious viral illness caused by the mumps virus, a member of the paramyxovirus family. It's best known for causing painful swelling of the parotid glands, which are salivary glands located in front of and below the ears, leading to a characteristic 'chipmunk cheek' appearance (parotitis). However, not everyone with mumps develops parotitis. Other symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection (incubation period can range from 12-25 days). Mumps is spread through respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing) or direct contact with saliva from an infected person. Before the widespread use of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, mumps was a common childhood illness.

    "general_advice": "Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of more than 30 inherited (genetic) diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of skeletal muscles that control movement. Different types of MD vary in terms of the specific muscles affected, age of onset, severity, and rate of progression. They are caused by mutations in genes responsible for producing proteins essential for muscle structure and function. Common types include: 1) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD): Most common and severe form in childhood, primarily affects boys (X-linked recessive). Rapidly progressive muscle weakness, often leading to wheelchair use by early teens and life-threatening heart/breathing problems by young adulthood. 2) Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD): Similar to DMD but milder and slower progression, also X-linked. 3) Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1, DM2): Most common adult-onset form. Characterized by myotonia (inability to relax muscles after contraction) and progressive muscle weakness/wasting, can also affect heart, eyes (cataracts), endocrine system, and brain. 4) Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD): Affects muscles of face, shoulders, upper arms. 5) Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies (LGMDs): Affect muscles around hips and shoulders. Many other rarer forms exist. Symptoms vary by type but generally include progressive muscle weakness, difficulty with motor skills (walking, running, climbing stairs, lifting), muscle cramps or stiffness, frequent falls, and sometimes joint contractures or scoliosis. Heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) and breathing muscles can also be affected.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a child shows signs of developmental delays in motor skills, muscle weakness, or unusual gait, or if an adult develops progressive muscle weakness, consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist, or neuromuscular specialist).

Seek immediate emergency medical attention for: severe difficulty breathing or swallowing, choking, slurred speech, inability to clear secretions, or extreme muscle weakness leading to respiratory failure. Also, cholinergic crisis (from overmedication with cholinesterase inhibitors) can cause similar weakness plus other symptoms (e.g., abdominal cramps, diarrhea, excessive salivation, pinpoint pupils, muscle twitching) and also needs urgent care.",
    "general_advice": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by fluctuating weakness and fatigability of voluntary muscles, which typically worsens with activity and improves with rest. It occurs when the immune system produces antibodies that block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) at the neuromuscular junction (the communication point between nerve endings and muscle fibers). This prevents muscle cells from receiving nerve signals effectively. Symptoms can vary in type and severity. Common early symptoms often involve eye muscles, causing: ptosis (drooping of one or both eyelids) and diplopia (double vision). Other muscles can also be affected, leading to: difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), slurred speech (dysarthria), difficulty chewing, weakness in facial muscles (affecting expression), weakness in neck muscles (head droop), and weakness in limb muscles (proximal muscles often more affected - e.g., difficulty climbing stairs, lifting arms, rising from a chair). Respiratory muscle weakness can occur in severe cases or during a crisis. Symptoms often fluctuate throughout the day, being better in the morning or after rest, and worse with exertion or at end of day.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience unexplained, fluctuating muscle weakness or fatigability, especially involving eye, facial, or swallowing muscles, consult a doctor (neurologist, often one specializing in neuromuscular disorders). Diagnosis involves a neurological exam, blood tests (for acetylcholine receptor antibodies - AChR-Ab, or MuSK antibodies - muscle-specific kinase Ab), electromyography (EMG) and single-fiber EMG, nerve conduction studies, and sometimes edrophonium (Tensilon) test (less common now) or ice pack test (for ptosis).

These can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of diverse bone marrow disorders characterized by ineffective production (dysplasia) of healthy blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets) in the bone marrow. This leads to low blood cell counts (cytopenias) in the peripheral blood, despite the bone marrow often being cellular or even hypercellular. MDS is considered a type of cancer, sometimes referred to as 'bone marrow failure disorder' or 'preleukemia' because it can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in about one-third of cases. MDS primarily affects older adults (most common over age 60), but can occur at any age. The exact cause is often unknown (primary MDS), but can be related to previous cancer treatment with chemotherapy or radiation (therapy-related MDS - t-MDS), or exposure to certain chemicals (e.g., benzene). Symptoms are often related to the specific cytopenias: Anemia (low red cells - most common): fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness. Neutropenia (low neutrophils - a type of white cell): recurrent or frequent infections. Thrombocytopenia (low platelets): easy bruising, bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, gum bleeding, petechiae). Some people may be asymptomatic at diagnosis, with MDS found on routine blood tests.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent, unexplained low blood counts or symptoms like fatigue, frequent infections, or easy bleeding/bruising, consult your doctor (primary care or hematologist/oncologist).

Myoclonus is a symptom, not a disease itself, and can have many different causes. 1) Physiological myoclonus: Occurs in healthy individuals and is normal (e.g., sleep starts/hypnic jerks as you fall asleep, hiccups). 2) Essential myoclonus: Occurs without an identifiable underlying cause and is not associated with other neurological abnormalities; can be inherited. 3) Epileptic myoclonus: Occurs as part of an epilepsy syndrome (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, progressive myoclonic epilepsies). 4) Symptomatic (secondary) myoclonus: Caused by an underlying medical condition, including: neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, brain injury, tumors, infections like encephalitis, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's/Parkinson's/Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), metabolic disorders (e.g., kidney or liver failure, electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia, hypoxia), drug toxicity or side effects (e.g., from opioids, antidepressants, levodopa, antihistamines), or exposure to certain toxins. Myoclonic jerks can be positive (caused by muscle contraction) or negative (caused by a brief interruption of muscle activity, like asterixis or 'flapping tremor').",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience new or bothersome myoclonic jerks, consult a doctor (neurologist). A thorough evaluation (neurological exam, medical history, blood tests, EEG, brain imaging like MRI, and sometimes other tests) is needed to determine the type and underlying cause of the myoclonus.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment depends on the underlying cause and severity of the myoclonus.",
      "  - If an underlying cause is identified, treating that condition is the primary goal (e.g., managing metabolic disorder, adjusting medication, treating infection).",
      "  - If myoclonus is part of an epilepsy syndrome, antiepileptic drugs (ASMs) are used.",
      "  - For symptomatic relief of myoclonus when the cause can't be reversed or if it's essential myoclonus, medications may be prescribed. Common drugs include: clonazepam (a benzodiazepine), valproic acid (an anticonvulsant), levetiracetam (an anticonvulsant), primidone (an anticonvulsant). Other drugs like piracetam or 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are sometimes tried.",
      "Identify and avoid any known triggers if applicable (e.g., stress, fatigue, certain stimuli for reflex myoclonus).",
      "Ensure adequate sleep and manage stress.",
      "If myoclonus affects daily activities (e.g., eating, writing, walking), occupational therapy and assistive devices may be helpful.",
      "Be cautious with activities that could be dangerous if a sudden jerk occurs (e.g., handling hot liquids, driving if severe - discuss with doctor)."

    "severity_level": "Low",
    "emergency_advice": "While myopia itself is not an emergency, seek immediate medical attention from an ophthalmologist if you experience sudden onset or increase in floaters, flashes of light, or a curtain-like shadow over your vision. High myopia is a risk factor for retinal detachment, which is a sight-threatening emergency.",
    "general_advice": "Myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness or short-sightedness, is a refractive error where distant objects appear blurry, while close-up objects are usually seen clearly. It occurs when the eyeball is too long from front to back, or the cornea (clear front surface of the eye) or lens has too much curvature. This causes light entering the eye to focus in front of the retina, instead of directly on it. Myopia often develops in childhood and can progress (worsen) during adolescence, usually stabilizing in early adulthood. It's very common and can range from mild to severe (high myopia). High myopia is associated with an increased risk of certain eye conditions later in life, such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, cataracts, and myopic maculopathy. Symptoms of myopia include: blurry distance vision (e.g., difficulty seeing a whiteboard, TV screen, or road signs clearly), squinting to see distant objects, eye strain, headaches, and sometimes fatigue when driving or playing sports.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child experiences blurry distance vision, difficulty seeing distant objects, or other symptoms of myopia, schedule a comprehensive eye examination with an optometrist or ophthalmologist. They can diagnose myopia and other refractive errors through various tests (e.g., visual acuity test, refraction test). Regular eye exams are important, especially for children, as uncorrected myopia can affect learning and development.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Myopia is typically corrected with:",
      "  - Eyeglasses: Concave (minus-powered) lenses are prescribed to help focus light correctly on the retina, improving distance vision.",
      "  - Contact lenses: Also use concave correction. Various types available.",
      "  - Refractive surgery: Procedures like LASIK, PRK, or SMILE can reshape the cornea to correct myopia. Implantable collamer lenses (ICLs) are another option for some.",
      "Wear your corrective lenses as prescribed by your eye doctor.",
      "Attend regular follow-up eye exams to ensure your prescription is up to date and to monitor for any changes or associated eye conditions, especially if you have high myopia.",
      "While controversial and evidence is still evolving, some strategies that may help slow myopia progression in children include: increased time spent outdoors, certain types of contact lenses (e.g., orthokeratology - 'ortho-K' lenses worn overnight, multifocal soft contact lenses), or low-dose atropine eye drops. Discuss these with a pediatric ophthalmologist or optometrist specializing in myopia control.",

    "general_advice": "Myositis refers to inflammation of the muscles. The term often encompasses a group of rare, chronic autoimmune diseases called inflammatory myopathies, where the body's immune system attacks muscle fibers, leading to muscle inflammation, weakness, and damage. The main types include: 1) Dermatomyositis (DM): Characterized by muscle weakness (usually proximal - shoulders, hips, thighs) and a characteristic skin rash (e.g., heliotrope rash - purplish rash on eyelids; Gottron's papules - reddish/purplish bumps over knuckles; shawl sign - rash on shoulders/upper back/chest). 2) Polymyositis (PM): Causes muscle weakness, similar to DM but without the characteristic skin rash. (PM as a distinct entity is now considered rarer, with many cases being reclassified). 3) Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM): Typically affects older individuals (over 50), causes slowly progressive weakness, often asymmetrically, affecting both proximal and distal muscles (e.g., finger flexors, quadriceps), and may involve swallowing muscles. Less responsive to immunosuppressive therapy. 4) Necrotizing Autoimmune Myopathy (NAM): Characterized by severe muscle weakness and high CK levels, with muscle fiber death seen on biopsy. Other causes of myositis can include infections (viral - e.g., influenza, HIV; bacterial - pyomyositis; parasitic - trichinosis), certain medications (e.g., statins - though usually causes myopathy/myalgia rather than true myositis, fibrates, colchicine), or toxins. Symptoms common to inflammatory myopathies include progressive muscle weakness (making tasks like climbing stairs, rising from a chair, lifting arms difficult), muscle pain or tenderness (myalgia), fatigue, and sometimes difficulty swallowing or breathing if those muscles are affected. Some myositis types can also involve other organs (lungs - interstitial lung disease, heart, joints).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop unexplained, progressive muscle weakness, persistent muscle pain, or a characteristic rash (for DM), consult your doctor (primary care, rheumatologist, or neurologist). Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical/neurological exam, blood tests (e.g., creatine kinase - CK levels are often very elevated, autoantibodies like anti-Jo-1, anti-Mi-2 for DM/PM), electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies, and often a muscle biopsy (to confirm inflammation and type of myositis).

Seek medical advice if symptoms are severe, uncontrolled, or leading to dangerous situations. Also, if experiencing severe depression or suicidal thoughts related to the impact of the disorder.",
    "general_advice": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) - an overwhelming urge to sleep during the day, often leading to unintended 'sleep attacks' even after adequate nighttime sleep. There are two main types: 1) Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1): Characterized by EDS AND cataplexy (sudden, brief episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis, often triggered by strong emotions like laughter, surprise, or anger; consciousness is usually maintained) OR low levels of hypocretin (orexin) - a brain chemical that regulates wakefulness - in cerebrospinal fluid. 2) Narcolepsy Type 2 (NT2): Characterized by EDS but WITHOUT cataplexy and with normal hypocretin levels. Other common symptoms of narcolepsy (can occur in both types, but cataplexy is specific to NT1) include: Sleep paralysis (temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up), Hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid, often frightening dream-like experiences while falling asleep) or Hypnopompic hallucinations (while waking up), and Disrupted nighttime sleep (frequent awakenings). The exact cause of narcolepsy is not fully understood, but NT1 is thought to be an autoimmune process that destroys hypocretin-producing cells in the hypothalamus. Genetic factors and environmental triggers may play a role.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent, excessive daytime sleepiness that interferes with your daily life, or other symptoms like cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or hallucinations, consult your doctor (primary care, neurologist, or sleep specialist). Diagnosis involves a detailed sleep history, clinical exam, and usually overnight sleep studies (polysomnogram - PSG) followed by a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT - measures how quickly you fall asleep during daytime naps and whether you enter REM sleep quickly).

    "general_advice": "Nasal polyps are soft, painless, non-cancerous (benign) growths that develop on the lining of the nasal passages or sinuses (air-filled cavities around the nose). They often look like small, teardrop-shaped or grape-like clusters hanging down from the mucous membranes. They result from chronic inflammation of the nasal/sinus lining and are often associated with conditions like: chronic rhinosinusitis (long-term sinus inflammation), allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, aspirin sensitivity (aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease - AERD, or Samter's triad: asthma, aspirin sensitivity, nasal polyps), cystic fibrosis, and certain immune disorders. Small nasal polyps may cause no symptoms. Larger polyps or clusters can block nasal passages and sinuses, leading to: persistent nasal congestion or stuffiness, runny nose (rhinorrhea), postnasal drip, reduced sense of smell (hyposmia or anosmia), reduced sense of taste, facial pain or pressure, headache, snoring, and sometimes sleep apnea. They can also contribute to recurrent sinus infections.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent nasal congestion, loss of smell, or other symptoms suggestive of nasal polyps, consult your doctor (primary care or ENT specialist).

This requires urgent surgical debridement and aggressive antibiotic therapy.",
    "general_advice": "Necrotizing fasciitis, sometimes called 'flesh-eating disease,' is a rare but very severe and rapidly progressive bacterial infection that destroys the soft tissues beneath the skin, including fascia (connective tissue surrounding muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels) and subcutaneous fat. It can occur after a minor cut, scrape, burn, insect bite, puncture wound, or surgical incision, or sometimes with no obvious entry point. Various bacteria can cause it, often a combination (polymicrobial), but Group A Streptococcus (GAS, 'flesh-eating bacteria') is a common culprit, as are *Staphylococcus aureus* (including MRSA), *Clostridium perfringens* (can cause gas gangrene, a type of necrotizing infection), and others. The bacteria release toxins that cause tissue death (necrosis) and impede blood flow, allowing the infection to spread quickly along fascial planes.

Very high bilirubin levels can lead to kernicterus, a rare but serious type of brain damage.",
    "general_advice": "Neonatal jaundice (newborn jaundice) is a common condition characterized by a yellowish discoloration of a newborn baby's skin and eyes (sclera). It's caused by an excess of bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced during the normal breakdown of old red blood cells. Newborns often have higher bilirubin levels because: 1) They have more red blood cells that break down faster. 2) Their liver is still immature and not fully efficient at processing and excreting bilirubin. 3) Their intestines may reabsorb more bilirubin. Physiological jaundice is the most common type, usually appears 2-4 days after birth, is mild, and resolves on its own within 1-2 weeks as the baby's liver matures. Breastfeeding jaundice can occur in the first week if baby is not getting enough breast milk (leading to dehydration and fewer bowel movements to excrete bilirubin). Breast milk jaundice can appear later (after first week) and last longer, thought to be due to substances in breast milk interfering with bilirubin processing (usually harmless if bilirubin doesn't get too high). Pathological jaundice (less common) can be due to underlying conditions like blood type incompatibility (e.g., Rh or ABO), liver disease, infections, enzyme deficiencies (e.g., G6PD deficiency), bruising from birth, or biliary atresia (blocked bile ducts).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "All newborns should be monitored for jaundice by a healthcare professional in the first few days of life. If jaundice is noticed, the doctor will assess its severity (often with a transcutaneous bilirubinometer or a blood test for bilirubin levels) and determine if treatment is needed. Follow-up appointments after hospital discharge are important for jaundice checks.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends on the bilirubin level, age of the baby, and underlying cause.",

      "  - For moderate to high bilirubin levels: Phototherapy ('bili lights') is the most common treatment. The baby is placed under special blue lights (undressed, with eyes protected) which help break down bilirubin in the skin so it can be excreted more easily.",
      "  - In very severe cases or if phototherapy is not effective enough: Exchange transfusion (where baby's blood is replaced with donor blood) may rarely be needed to rapidly lower bilirubin levels and prevent kernicterus.",
      "  - If an underlying cause is identified (e.g., infection, blood incompatibility), that will also be treated.",
      "Ensure frequent feedings (breastfeed 8-12 times a day, or formula as directed) to promote hydration and stooling.",

These tumors are usually benign (non-cancerous) but can sometimes become malignant. NF can also affect skin, bones, eyes, and other organ systems. The types are: 1) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, formerly von Recklinghausen's disease): Most common type. Caused by mutation in NF1 gene. Characterized by: multiple café-au-lait spots (flat, light brown skin patches), neurofibromas (soft bumps on or under skin, can also be internal), Lisch nodules (tiny bumps on iris of eye), axillary (armpit) or inguinal (groin) freckling, optic pathway gliomas (tumors on optic nerve), learning disabilities, ADHD, bone deformities (e.g., scoliosis, bowing of legs), and increased risk of certain cancers. 2) Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2): Rarer. Caused by mutation in NF2 gene. Characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (benign tumors on the nerves for balance and hearing, leading to hearing loss, tinnitus, balance problems). Also associated with other tumors like schwannomas on other nerves, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Cataracts can occur at a young age. 3) Schwannomatosis: Rarest type. Characterized by multiple schwannomas (benign nerve sheath tumors) throughout the body, often causing chronic pain. Usually does not involve vestibular schwannomas typical of NF2. All types are caused by genetic mutations (can be inherited or occur spontaneously). Severity and manifestations vary greatly, even within families.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has signs or symptoms suggestive of NF (e.g., multiple café-au-lait spots, skin lumps, learning issues, hearing loss/balance problems, chronic pain with nerve tumors), consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist, geneticist, or dermatologist). Diagnosis is based on specific clinical criteria for each type, and genetic testing can confirm the mutation. Management requires a multidisciplinary team experienced in NF.",

    "emergency_advice": "Seek medical attention if drug-induced neuropathy symptoms are severe, rapidly progressing, involve significant muscle weakness (especially if affecting breathing or swallowing - though this is rare for most drug-induced neuropathies unless it's part of a more severe syndrome like Guillain-Barré which can rarely be drug-triggered), or if there's unbearable pain. Any new or worsening neurological symptoms while on medication should be reported to the prescribing doctor.",
    "general_advice": "Drug-induced peripheral neuropathy is damage to peripheral nerves (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord) caused as a side effect of certain medications. Many different drugs can potentially cause neuropathy. The type of nerve damage (e.g., affecting sensory, motor, or autonomic nerves; axonal vs. demyelinating) and symptoms can vary depending on the drug, dose, duration of use, and individual susceptibility. Symptoms often start in the longest nerves first (feet and hands - 'stocking-glove' distribution) and can include: Numbness, Tingling ('pins and needles') or burning sensations (paresthesias), Pain (can be sharp, shooting, burning - neuropathic pain), Muscle weakness, Difficulty with balance or coordination, Loss of reflexes, and sometimes autonomic symptoms (e.g., dizziness upon standing, bowel/bladder problems, sweating abnormalities). Common classes of drugs associated with neuropathy include: certain chemotherapy agents (e.g., vincristine, cisplatin, paclitaxel, bortezomib), some antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, fluoroquinolones), antiretroviral drugs (for HIV), amiodarone (heart rhythm drug), colchicine (for gout), phenytoin (anticonvulsant), statins (cholesterol drugs - neuropathy is rare and usually mild), and others. Heavy metal poisoning (e.g., lead, mercury, arsenic) can also cause neuropathy.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy while taking medication, report them to your prescribing doctor. Do not stop or change your medication dosage without medical advice. Your doctor will evaluate whether the medication is the likely cause, consider alternative treatments if necessary, and may refer you to a neurologist. Diagnosis involves a neurological exam, and often nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG).",

    "general_advice": "'Neurosis' is an older, historical term in psychiatry that was used to describe a class of mental disorders characterized by chronic distress, anxiety, and maladaptive coping mechanisms, but without loss of contact with reality (i.e., no psychosis). The term is no longer used in modern diagnostic systems like the DSM-5 or ICD-11. Conditions that were previously often categorized as neuroses are now typically diagnosed under more specific categories such as: Anxiety Disorders (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Phobias, Social Anxiety Disorder), Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (e.g., OCD), Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders (e.g., PTSD, Adjustment Disorder), and some forms of Depressive Disorders (e.g., Persistent Depressive Disorder/Dysthymia). Common features often included excessive worry, anxiety, fear, irritability, rumination, obsessions, compulsions, somatic symptoms (physical complaints without clear medical cause), and difficulties in interpersonal relationships or daily functioning, all while reality testing remained intact.

    "general_advice": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of excess fat (steatosis) in the liver of people who drink little or no alcohol. It's very common and often associated with metabolic syndrome (obesity, type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance, high cholesterol/triglycerides, high blood pressure). NAFLD exists on a spectrum: 1) Simple fatty liver (NAFL or nonalcoholic fatty liver): Fat in liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Usually benign and doesn't progress to serious liver damage. 2) Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): A more severe form where, in addition to fat, there is inflammation (hepatitis) and liver cell damage. NASH can lead to fibrosis (scarring) of the liver, and can progress to cirrhosis (advanced, irreversible scarring) and its complications (liver failure, portal hypertension, liver cancer - HCC). NAFLD/NASH are often asymptomatic, especially in early stages, and may be discovered incidentally through abnormal liver enzyme tests on routine blood work or imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) showing fatty liver. When symptoms do occur (usually in more advanced stages or with NASH), they can be vague and include fatigue, weakness, dull discomfort or pain in the upper right abdomen, and sometimes unexplained weight loss.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have risk factors for NAFLD/NASH (obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome) or if abnormal liver tests or fatty liver are found, consult your doctor (primary care, gastroenterologist, or hepatologist). Further evaluation may be needed to assess the severity of liver involvement (e.g., liver biopsy was gold standard but non-invasive tests like FibroScan/elastography or specialized blood tests are increasingly used to estimate fibrosis).",

Also if symptoms occur in very young, elderly, or immunocompromised individuals.",
    "general_advice": "Noninfectious gastroenteritis refers to inflammation of the stomach and intestines that is NOT caused by an infection with viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Instead, it can be triggered by other factors, such as: 1) Medications: Many drugs can cause GI upset, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea as a side effect (e.g., some antibiotics, NSAIDs, chemotherapy drugs, metformin, colchicine). 2) Toxins: Ingestion of certain chemical toxins, heavy metals, or poisonous plants/mushrooms. 3) Food intolerances or sensitivities (though often considered separately, can cause gastroenteritis-like symptoms, e.g., lactose intolerance, non-celiac gluten sensitivity). 4) Ischemia: Reduced blood flow to the intestines (ischemic enterocolitis - see Bowel Ischemia) can cause inflammation and symptoms. 5) Radiation therapy: Radiation to the abdomen or pelvis can cause radiation enteritis/colitis. 6) Allergic reactions: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (an allergic inflammatory condition). 7) Certain inflammatory conditions: e.g., an acute flare of IBD (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis) can present with gastroenteritis-like symptoms. Symptoms are similar to infectious gastroenteritis and can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or cramping, and sometimes bloating or loss of appetite.",

    "general_advice": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a neurological disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles, causing them to enlarge, but with little or no increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) when measured by a standard lumbar puncture (though CSF pressure may fluctuate or be intermittently elevated). It typically affects older adults (usually over 60). The exact cause is often unknown (idiopathic NPH), but it can sometimes occur secondary to conditions that interfere with CSF absorption or flow, such as head trauma, brain surgery, subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, or tumors. NPH is characterized by a classic triad of symptoms (though not all may be present or appear simultaneously): 1) Gait disturbance: Difficulty walking, often described as a shuffling, magnetic (feet seem stuck to floor), wide-based, or unsteady gait. Balance problems and falls are common. 2) Cognitive decline/Dementia: Memory loss, slowed thinking, difficulty with attention and concentration, apathy, and changes in personality or behavior. 3) Urinary incontinence: Urinary urgency, frequency, or frank incontinence. Symptoms often develop gradually.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If an older adult develops progressive problems with walking, memory/thinking, and/or bladder control, consult a doctor (primary care, neurologist, or neurosurgeon). NPH is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (e.g., as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease) because its symptoms can mimic other conditions of aging. Diagnosis involves a neurological exam, brain imaging (MRI or CT scan showing enlarged ventricles out of proportion to brain atrophy), and often specialized tests like a large-volume lumbar puncture (spinal tap - to see if symptoms temporarily improve after removing CSF) or external CSF drainage trial. Sometimes CSF flow studies are done.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "NPH is potentially treatable, especially if diagnosed early. The primary treatment is surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt (or other type of shunt like ventriculoatrial). A shunt is a tube system that diverts excess CSF from the brain ventricles to another part of the body (usually the abdomen) where it can be absorbed. Shunts have a valve to regulate flow and pressure.",

The individual often tries to ignore or suppress them, or to neutralize them with another thought or action (a compulsion). Common obsessions include: fears of contamination/germs, doubts (e.g., about having locked a door or turned off stove), need for order/symmetry, aggressive or horrific thoughts, or unwanted sexual thoughts. 2) Compulsions (rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., handwashing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety/distress or preventing some dreaded event/situation; however, they are not realistically connected to what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.

    "emergency_advice": "While OSA is a chronic condition, seek urgent medical attention if you experience: severe daytime sleepiness leading to accidents (e.g., while driving); acute respiratory distress or severe worsening of breathing at night; or significant cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., chest pain, severe arrhythmias) that could be related to complications of untreated severe OSA.",
    "general_advice": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete blockage (obstruction) of the upper airway during sleep, leading to pauses in breathing (apneas) or shallow breathing (hypopneas). These episodes cause intermittent drops in blood oxygen levels and brief awakenings (arousals) from sleep, disrupting sleep quality. The obstruction usually occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax too much during sleep, allowing soft tissues (e.g., tongue, soft palate, uvula) to collapse and block the airway. Common symptoms include: loud snoring (often with pauses in breathing followed by gasps or snorts), excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue (even after a full night's sleep), morning headaches, difficulty concentrating or memory problems, irritability or mood changes, dry mouth or sore throat upon waking, and frequent nighttime awakenings or insomnia. Risk factors include: obesity (excess weight around neck can narrow airway), older age, male sex, family history, anatomical features (e.g., large tonsils/adenoids, small jaw, large tongue), nasal congestion, alcohol or sedative use (can relax throat muscles), and smoking. Untreated OSA can lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease (heart attack, stroke, arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation), type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and increased risk of accidents due to daytime sleepiness.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your bed partner notices symptoms of OSA (especially loud snoring with gasping/pauses in breathing, or excessive daytime sleepiness), consult your doctor (primary care or sleep specialist). Diagnosis involves a sleep history, physical exam, and usually an overnight sleep study (polysomnogram - PSG, either in a sleep lab or sometimes at home) to monitor breathing, oxygen levels, heart rate, brain activity, and body movements during sleep.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment aims to keep the airway open during sleep, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications. It's guided by a sleep specialist.",
      "  - Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy: Mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe OSA. A machine delivers a constant stream of air through a mask worn over the nose or nose/mouth, keeping the airway open. Other forms of positive airway pressure (e.g., APAP, BiPAP) may also be used.",
      "  - Oral appliances (mandibular advancement devices - MADs): Custom-fitted dental devices that reposition the lower jaw and tongue forward to open the airway. An option for mild to moderate OSA or those who can't tolerate CPAP.",
      "  - Lifestyle modifications:",
      "    - Weight loss if overweight or obese (can significantly improve or even resolve OSA in some).",
      "    - Positional therapy: Avoid sleeping on your back (supine position), as this often worsens apnea. Try sleeping on your side (e.g., using special pillows or devices).",
      "    - Avoid alcohol and sedative medications, especially before bedtime.",
      "    - Quit smoking.",
      "    - Treat nasal congestion (e.g., with nasal steroids or decongestants if appropriate) to improve nasal airflow.",
      "  - Surgical options: May be considered if other treatments fail or are not tolerated, and if there's an identifiable anatomical obstruction that can be corrected (e.g., uvulopalatopharyngoplasty - UPPP, tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, maxillomandibular advancement, hypoglossal nerve stimulation). Results vary.",
      "Regular follow-up with your sleep specialist is important to ensure treatment effectiveness and adherence (especially with CPAP)."

    "severity_level": "Medium",
    "emergency_advice": "Omphalitis can progress rapidly and lead to serious systemic infection (sepsis) if not treated promptly. Seek immediate medical attention if a newborn's umbilical stump or navel area shows: significant redness spreading around the navel, warmth, swelling, tenderness, pus or foul-smelling discharge, or if the baby has a fever, is lethargic, irritable, feeding poorly, or seems generally unwell. This is especially urgent in premature or low-birth-weight infants.",
    "general_advice": "Omphalitis is an infection of the umbilical stump (the remaining part of the umbilical cord) and/or the surrounding skin (periumbilical area) in a newborn baby. It's usually caused by bacteria that colonize the stump after birth (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*, Group A Streptococcus, *E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*). The umbilical stump normally dries up and falls off within 1-3 weeks after birth, leaving a healing navel. Omphalitis occurs when this area becomes infected. While relatively uncommon in developed countries with good hygiene practices, it can be a serious condition with potential for rapid spread of infection into the bloodstream (sepsis), abdominal wall (cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis - rare), or liver (portal vein thrombosis). Symptoms include redness, swelling, warmth, tenderness, and pus or foul-smelling discharge from the umbilical stump or navel. The baby may also have a fever, be irritable, lethargic, or feed poorly.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice any signs of infection around your newborn's umbilical stump or navel, contact your pediatrician or seek medical care immediately. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are crucial.",

    "general_advice": "Onychomycosis, also known as tinea unguium or fungal nail infection, is a common infection of the fingernails or, more frequently, toenails by fungi (dermatophytes, yeasts like Candida, or molds). The infection usually starts at the tip or side of the nail and can spread to involve the entire nail plate and nail bed. Symptoms can include: discoloration of the nail (often yellowish, brownish, or whitish), thickening of the nail, brittleness or crumbling of the nail, distortion of nail shape, debris accumulating under the nail, and sometimes separation of the nail from the nail bed (onycholysis). The affected nail may also have a foul odor. Onychomycosis is often asymptomatic initially, but can become unsightly and sometimes painful, especially if the nail becomes very thick or ingrown. Risk factors include older age, poor circulation, diabetes, weakened immune system, history of athlete's foot (tinea pedis - fungi can spread from skin to nails), nail trauma, wearing occlusive footwear that keeps feet warm and moist, and frequent exposure to damp environments (e.g., public showers, pools).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect a fungal nail infection, especially if it's bothersome, spreading, or if you have risk factors for complications, consult a doctor or podiatrist/dermatologist. Diagnosis is often made by clinical appearance, but confirmation may involve taking nail clippings or scrapings for microscopic examination (KOH prep) or fungal culture, as other conditions can mimic fungal nails (e.g., psoriasis, trauma). Treatment can be challenging and may take a long time, as nails grow slowly.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Over-the-counter (OTC) topical antifungal creams, lotions, or polishes are available but often have limited effectiveness for established onychomycosis, as they don't penetrate the nail well. They may be more helpful for very superficial infections or prevention.",
      "Prescription treatments (from your doctor):",
      "  - Oral antifungal medications (e.g., terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole): Generally the most effective treatment, but require several months of therapy and can have potential side effects (e.g., liver problems, drug interactions), so medical supervision and monitoring are needed.",
      "  - Prescription topical antifungal nail lacquers or solutions (e.g., ciclopirox, efinaconazole, tavaborole): Applied directly to the nail, often daily for many months. May be used for milder infections or in combination with oral therapy, or if oral drugs are contraindicated.",
      "  - Laser therapy or photodynamic therapy: Newer options, effectiveness and long-term results are still being studied.",
      "  - Surgical nail removal (avulsion): Rarely done, may be considered for very thick, painful, or resistant infections, often in combination with antifungal treatment.",
      "Good foot hygiene:",
      "  - Keep nails trimmed short and clean.",
      "  - Dry feet thoroughly after bathing, especially between toes.",
      "  - Wear breathable socks (cotton, wool, moisture-wicking) and change them daily or if sweaty.",
      "  - Wear shoes that allow air circulation; alternate shoes to let them dry out.",
      "  - Wear shower shoes in public showers, locker rooms, and around pools.",
      "  - Treat any co-existing athlete's foot (tinea pedis) to prevent spread to nails.",
      "  - Avoid sharing nail clippers or footwear.",

Also seek urgent care for signs of a significant surgical site infection (SSI): rapidly spreading redness, warmth, significant swelling, severe or increasing pain, foul-smelling pus draining from the wound, fever, chills, or if you feel generally unwell. Any concern about a surgical wound not healing properly warrants prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "An open wound from a surgical incision can occur if the incision line partially or completely separates (dehiscence) after surgery, or if a surgical site infection (SSI) develops and causes the wound to break down or require opening for drainage. Dehiscence can range from a small superficial opening to a complete separation of all layers. SSIs are infections that occur in the part of the body where surgery took place, and can be superficial (involving skin only), deep incisional (involving muscle and fascia), or organ/space (involving an organ or body cavity). Risk factors for wound healing problems include: infection, poor nutrition, obesity, diabetes, smoking, weakened immune system, certain medications (e.g., steroids), poor blood supply to the area, excessive tension on the wound, or improper wound care. Symptoms of dehiscence include a gap or opening in the incision line, sometimes with drainage. Symptoms of SSI include redness, pain, swelling, warmth, pus, fever (see also Wound Infection).",

While optic neuritis itself may not always be an immediate emergency if vision loss is mild, it's crucial to rule out other serious conditions and to get a prompt diagnosis, as it can be the first sign of multiple sclerosis (MS) or other neurological/autoimmune disorders. Prompt treatment (if indicated) can sometimes improve visual recovery.",
    "general_advice": "Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve, the bundle of nerve fibers that transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. This inflammation can damage the myelin sheath (protective covering) of the optic nerve, disrupting nerve signals and causing vision problems. It most commonly affects one eye, but can affect both. The exact cause is often unknown (idiopathic), but it is strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) - in fact, optic neuritis is often the first demyelinating event in MS. Other causes can include: other autoimmune diseases (e.g., neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder - NMOSD, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease - MOGAD, sarcoidosis, lupus), infections (viral - e.g., measles, mumps, herpes; bacterial - e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis; fungal - rare), certain medications, or vitamin deficiencies (rare). Symptoms typically include: pain in the affected eye, often worse with eye movement; vision loss or blurred vision in one eye (can range from mild to severe, develops over hours to days); reduced color vision (colors may appear faded or less vivid); and sometimes flashing lights (photopsia).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop any symptoms of optic neuritis, see an ophthalmologist or neurologist promptly. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive eye exam (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field testing, dilated fundus exam to look at optic disc), and often imaging (MRI of the brain and orbits, with contrast, to look for inflammation of optic nerve and demyelinating lesions in brain suggestive of MS). Blood tests or lumbar puncture may be done to investigate underlying causes.",

Steroids can speed up visual recovery but may not affect long-term visual outcome.",
      "  - Treatment of underlying cause: If an infection or systemic autoimmune disease is identified, that condition will be treated.",
      "  - If optic neuritis is determined to be the first event of MS, discussion about starting disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS will occur to reduce future relapses and disability.",

Most leukoplakia is benign (non-cancerous), but some patches can show precancerous changes (dysplasia) and have the potential to develop into oral squamous cell carcinoma (a type of mouth cancer) over time. The risk of malignant transformation depends on the type and severity of dysplasia, if present. Hairy leukoplakia is a specific type often seen in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS), caused by Epstein-Barr virus, and is usually benign. Common risk factors for developing leukoplakia include: tobacco use (smoking, chewing tobacco, snuff - most significant risk factor), heavy alcohol consumption (especially when combined with tobacco), chronic irritation from rough teeth, dentures, or dental appliances, and possibly Candida infection or HPV. The patches are often painless initially.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a persistent white patch or plaque in your mouth, see your dentist or doctor. Diagnosis often involves a clinical exam, and a biopsy of the lesion is usually necessary to examine the cells under a microscope, determine if dysplasia is present, and rule out cancer. Regular dental check-ups are important for early detection.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "The primary goal of management is to eliminate risk factors and monitor or remove the lesion to prevent cancer development.",
      "  - Eliminate irritants: Stop all forms of tobacco use. Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption. Address any dental issues causing chronic irritation (e.g., smooth rough teeth, adjust dentures).",
      "  - Observation: Small, benign leukoplakic patches without dysplasia may be monitored closely by your dentist/doctor with regular follow-up exams (e.g., every 3-12 months).",
      "  - Removal of lesion: If dysplasia is present, or if the lesion is persistent, growing, or in a high-risk location, surgical removal (e.g., with scalpel, laser, or cryotherapy - freezing) is often recommended. Even after removal, recurrence is possible, and new lesions can develop.",
      "  - Medications: Topical or systemic retinoids or other agents have been tried for some cases, but effectiveness is variable and side effects can be an issue.",

    "general_advice": "Oral thrush, also known as oral candidiasis or oropharyngeal candidiasis, is a yeast infection of the mucous membranes lining the mouth and sometimes the throat. It's caused by an overgrowth of a type of fungus called *Candida*, most commonly *Candida albicans*. A small amount of Candida normally lives in the mouth without causing problems, but certain factors can disrupt the balance and allow it to overgrow, leading to infection. Common symptoms include: creamy white, slightly raised patches or lesions in the mouth (often on the tongue, inner cheeks, roof of mouth, gums, or tonsils - may look like cottage cheese; can sometimes be scraped off, leaving a red, raw, or slightly bleeding surface underneath); redness, soreness, or burning sensation in the mouth; difficulty swallowing or a feeling of food getting stuck (if it extends to esophagus); cracking and redness at the corners of the mouth (angular cheilitis); loss of taste or an unpleasant taste; and sometimes a cottony feeling in the mouth. Risk factors for oral thrush include: infancy (newborns can get it), weakened immune system (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, on immunosuppressive drugs), use of inhaled corticosteroids (for asthma/COPD - if mouth not rinsed after use), antibiotic use (can disrupt normal oral flora), denture wear (especially if not cleaned properly or ill-fitting), dry mouth (xerostomia), smoking, and diabetes (especially if poorly controlled).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you or your child has oral thrush, consult your doctor or dentist. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical appearance. Sometimes a scraping from a lesion may be examined under a microscope (KOH prep) or cultured to confirm Candida. Treatment with antifungal medication is usually needed.",

Prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial to prevent vision loss, spread of infection to the brain (meningitis, brain abscess), or cavernous sinus thrombosis.",
    "general_advice": "Orbital cellulitis is an infection and inflammation of the soft tissues located behind the orbital septum, which is a fibrous membrane that separates the anterior eyelid from the deeper orbital contents. This means the infection involves the contents of the eye socket itself (fat, muscles that move the eye, optic nerve). It's different from preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis, which is an infection of the eyelid and tissues in front of the orbital septum (less serious, though still needs treatment). Orbital cellulitis is most commonly caused by the spread of a bacterial infection from adjacent structures, especially the paranasal sinuses (ethmoid sinusitis is a common precursor, particularly in children). Other causes include: extension from preseptal cellulitis, dental infections, facial infections, trauma to the eye or orbit (e.g., penetrating injury, fracture), or rarely, hematogenous spread (from bloodstream infection). Common bacteria involved include *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and *Haemophilus influenzae*.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical evaluation by an ophthalmologist and often an ENT specialist is essential if orbital cellulitis is suspected. Diagnosis involves a thorough eye and orbital exam, assessment of vision and eye movements, and often imaging (CT scan or MRI of the orbits and sinuses) to confirm the diagnosis, assess the extent of infection, and look for complications like abscess formation. Blood tests (CBC, blood cultures) may also be done.",

Also, if it's a new or rapidly worsening problem, it's important to find the underlying cause.",
    "general_advice": "Orthostatic hypotension, also known as postural hypotension, is a form of low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up from a sitting or lying down position. It's defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (top number) of at least 20 mmHg or a drop in diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing. When you stand up, gravity causes blood to pool in your legs and abdomen, which can temporarily reduce blood flow to the brain if the body doesn't compensate quickly enough by constricting blood vessels and increasing heart rate. This can lead to symptoms like: dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, fainting (syncope) or near-fainting, confusion, nausea, or headache. Symptoms are usually brief and resolve when you sit or lie down again. Common causes include: dehydration, certain medications (e.g., diuretics, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, some antidepressants, drugs for Parkinson's disease or erectile dysfunction), prolonged bed rest or immobility, older age (autonomic reflexes may be slower), heat exposure, large meals, alcohol, and underlying medical conditions (e.g., heart problems like arrhythmias or valve disease, endocrine disorders like adrenal insufficiency or diabetes, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease or autonomic neuropathy - common in diabetes).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you frequently experience symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially if it leads to falls or fainting, consult your doctor. They can measure your blood pressure sitting and standing to confirm the diagnosis, review your medications, and investigate potential underlying causes. An EKG, echocardiogram, or autonomic function tests may be done if needed.",

    "general_advice": "Osteoarthritis (OA), often called degenerative joint disease or 'wear-and-tear' arthritis, is the most common form of arthritis. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones within a joint gradually wears down over time. Eventually, if the cartilage wears away completely, bone can rub on bone, causing pain and restricted movement. OA can affect any joint but most commonly occurs in weight-bearing joints like the knees and hips, as well as the hands (especially finger joints and base of thumb), spine (neck and lower back), and big toes. Symptoms develop gradually and can include: joint pain (often an aching pain that worsens with activity or at the end of the day, and may improve with rest initially), stiffness (especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity, usually lasting less than 30 minutes), limited range of motion, tenderness when pressing on the joint, a grating or crackling sensation (crepitus) when moving the joint, and sometimes swelling or bony enlargements (osteophytes or bone spurs) around the joint (e.g., Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes in finger joints). Risk factors include older age, female sex (especially after menopause), obesity, previous joint injuries or overuse, genetics/family history, and certain occupations or activities involving repetitive stress on joints.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent joint pain, stiffness, or swelling that limits your daily activities, consult your doctor (primary care, rheumatologist, or orthopedist). Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, physical exam, and X-rays (which can show joint space narrowing, bone spurs, and other changes). There is no blood test to diagnose OA, but tests may be done to rule out other types of arthritis.",

Malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma is rare (<1% for solitary, slightly higher for multiple hereditary exostoses) but needs to be ruled out if there are suspicious changes.",
    "general_advice": "An osteochondroma, also known as an exostosis, is the most common type of benign (non-cancerous) bone tumor. It's an overgrowth of cartilage and bone that typically occurs near the end of a long bone, near the growth plate (physis). Osteochondromas usually develop during childhood or adolescence when bones are still growing and stop growing once skeletal maturity is reached. They often look like a mushroom-shaped projection from the bone surface, with a bony stalk and a cartilage cap. Common locations include the femur (thighbone, especially near knee), tibia (shinbone, near knee), and humerus (upper arm bone, near shoulder). Most osteochondromas are solitary and cause no symptoms, often found incidentally on X-rays done for other reasons. When symptoms do occur, they can include: a hard, painless, immobile lump near a joint; pain if the growth irritates nearby tendons, muscles, or nerves, or if the overlying bursa becomes inflamed (bursitis); restricted range of motion in a nearby joint; or limb length discrepancy if growth plate is affected (rare). Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME), also called Multiple Osteochondromas (MO), is a genetic condition where multiple osteochondromas develop throughout the skeleton.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has a palpable bony lump, especially near a joint, or experiences pain or other symptoms potentially related to an osteochondroma, consult a doctor (primary care or orthopedist). Diagnosis is usually made with X-rays. MRI or CT scan may be used if there's uncertainty, pain, or suspicion of complications.",

    "general_advice": "Osteochondrosis is a general term for a group of disorders affecting bone growth in children and adolescents, particularly at the epiphyses (ends of long bones where growth occurs) and apophyses (sites where major tendons attach to bone). These disorders typically involve a disruption of blood supply to the affected bone growth center, leading to abnormal bone development, degeneration, necrosis (tissue death), and sometimes fragmentation, followed by regeneration or healing. The exact cause is often unknown but may involve genetic predisposition, repetitive microtrauma or overuse, rapid growth spurts, or vascular factors. Specific osteochondroses are often named after the physician who first described them or the anatomical location. Examples include: 1) Osgood-Schlatter disease: Affects tibial tubercle (bony bump below kneecap where patellar tendon attaches). Common in active adolescents. Causes pain, swelling, tenderness below kneecap. 2) Sever's disease (Calcaneal Apophysitis): Affects growth plate at back of heel bone (calcaneus). Common in active children. Causes heel pain. 3) Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease: Affects femoral head (ball of hip joint). Causes hip/groin/knee pain, limp. Can lead to deformity and early osteoarthritis. 4) Scheuermann's disease (Juvenile Kyphosis): Affects thoracic spine, causing wedge-shaped vertebrae and increased rounding of upper back. 5) Köhler's disease: Affects navicular bone in foot. 6) Freiberg's disease: Affects metatarsal head (usually second) in foot. 7) Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD): A localized condition where a segment of bone and overlying cartilage separates from the joint surface (often knee, elbow, ankle). Can cause pain, swelling, locking, loose body in joint. Symptoms vary by condition but often include pain (worse with activity, better with rest), tenderness, swelling, and sometimes limited range of motion or limp.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a child or adolescent experiences persistent joint pain, swelling, limping, or limited movement, especially related to activity, consult a doctor (pediatrician, sports medicine physician, or orthopedic specialist).

    "general_advice": "Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone. It can be caused by bacteria (most common, e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*) or, less frequently, fungi. The infection can reach the bone through several routes: 1) Hematogenous spread: Bacteria travel through the bloodstream from an infection elsewhere in the body (e.g., skin infection, UTI, respiratory infection) and seed the bone. More common in children, often affecting long bones. 2) Direct inoculation/contiguous spread: Infection spreads to bone from an adjacent infected wound, soft tissue infection (cellulitis), or during trauma (e.g., open fracture, penetrating injury) or surgery (e.g., joint replacement, internal fixation of fracture). 3) Vascular insufficiency: Impaired blood flow (e.g., in diabetes, peripheral artery disease) can make bones more susceptible to infection, especially in the feet (diabetic foot osteomyelitis). Osteomyelitis can be acute (sudden onset, rapid progression) or chronic (long-lasting, may have periods of quiescence and flare-ups, often with dead bone - sequestrum - and draining sinus tracts). Symptoms can include: localized bone pain (often deep, throbbing, constant), tenderness, swelling, redness, and warmth over the affected area; fever and chills (more common in acute); fatigue; general malaise; and sometimes pus drainage from a skin opening near the infected bone. In children, they may refuse to use the affected limb.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of osteomyelitis, especially if you have risk factors (e.g., recent trauma/surgery, diabetes, poor circulation, weakened immune system, IV drug use), consult your doctor immediately. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, blood tests (CBC, inflammatory markers like ESR/CRP, blood cultures), imaging (X-rays may be normal early on; bone scan, MRI, or CT scan are more sensitive for detecting bone infection and inflammation), and often a bone biopsy (to identify the causative organism and confirm diagnosis).",

Bones become weak, brittle, and more likely to break from minor falls or even everyday stresses. It's often called a 'silent disease' because there are usually no symptoms until a fracture occurs. Common fracture sites include the hip, spine (vertebral compression fractures - can cause back pain, loss of height, stooped posture/kyphosis), and wrist. Bone is a living tissue that is constantly being broken down (resorption) and rebuilt (formation). Osteoporosis occurs when bone resorption outpaces bone formation, or when peak bone mass achieved in young adulthood is insufficient. Risk factors include: older age (bone loss accelerates after menopause in women and with aging in men), female sex, postmenopausal status (due to estrogen deficiency), low calcium and vitamin D intake, sedentary lifestyle/lack of weight-bearing exercise, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, family history of osteoporosis or fractures, small body frame/low body weight, certain medications (e.g., long-term corticosteroid use, some anticonvulsants, aromatase inhibitors), and certain medical conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypogonadism, chronic kidney or liver disease).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Talk to your doctor about your risk for osteoporosis and when to have a bone density test (DXA or DEXA scan - dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone mineral density (BMD). Screening is typically recommended for women age 65 and older, men age 70 and older, or younger individuals with significant risk factors or previous fragility fractures. If diagnosed, management aims to slow bone loss, prevent fractures, and maintain function.",
    "self_care_tips": [

    "general_advice": "Otitis externa, commonly known as swimmer's ear, is an inflammation or infection of the external ear canal (the tube running from the outer ear to the eardrum). It's often caused by bacteria (e.g., *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Staphylococcus aureus*) or, less commonly, fungi, that thrive in a moist environment when water gets trapped in the ear canal (e.g., after swimming, bathing, or in humid climates). Other contributing factors include: damage to the skin lining the ear canal (e.g., from scratching, using cotton swabs, or wearing hearing aids/earbuds), allergic reactions (e.g., to hair products, earrings), or skin conditions (e.g., eczema, psoriasis). Symptoms include: ear pain (otalgia - can be mild to severe, often worse when the outer ear/tragus is pulled or touched), itching in the ear canal, redness and swelling of the ear canal, a feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear, muffled hearing or temporary hearing loss, and sometimes discharge from the ear (can be clear, cloudy, or pus-like).",

Also, if there's sudden, significant hearing loss or bloody/pus-filled discharge after severe pain (could be eardrum rupture).",
    "general_advice": "Otitis media is a general term for inflammation or infection of the middle ear, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear. Common types include: 1) Acute Otitis Media (AOM): A middle ear infection, usually bacterial or viral, often following a cold or upper respiratory infection. Causes sudden onset of ear pain (otalgia), fever, irritability, and sometimes fluid drainage if eardrum ruptures. Common in young children. (See separate entry for AOM if more detail needed). 2) Otitis Media with Effusion (OME, 'glue ear'): Fluid (effusion) buildup in the middle ear without signs of acute infection. Can cause muffled hearing or a feeling of fullness in the ear. Often occurs after AOM resolves or due to Eustachian tube dysfunction. 3) Chronic Otitis Media (COM): Long-term middle ear inflammation/infection, often with a perforated eardrum and persistent or recurrent ear discharge. Can lead to hearing loss and other complications. (See separate entry for COM). Symptoms of otitis media vary by type and severity but can include ear pain, fever, hearing loss/muffled hearing, feeling of fullness in ear, irritability (especially in infants/toddlers who may tug at ear), fluid drainage, and sometimes dizziness or balance issues.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has symptoms of an ear infection or persistent middle ear fluid, consult a doctor (pediatrician, primary care, or ENT specialist). They can diagnose the type of otitis media with an otoscope and tympanometer, and recommend appropriate treatment.",

    "general_advice": "Otosclerosis is a condition affecting the middle ear characterized by abnormal bone remodeling (growth) in the bones of the middle ear, primarily around the stapes (the smallest of the three tiny bones, also called the 'stirrup'). This abnormal bone growth causes the stapes to become fixed or 'stuck' in place, preventing it from vibrating properly in response to sound waves. This impairs the transmission of sound from the middle ear to the inner ear (cochlea), resulting in progressive conductive hearing loss (sound doesn't conduct efficiently). The hearing loss is often bilateral (affecting both ears, though may be asymmetrical) and typically starts in young adulthood (ages 15-45). Some people with otosclerosis also experience tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ears) and, less commonly, dizziness or balance problems if the inner ear structures are involved (cochlear otosclerosis, which can cause sensorineural hearing loss as well). The exact cause is unknown, but genetic factors play a significant role (often runs in families). It may also be influenced by hormonal factors (can worsen during pregnancy) or viral infections (e.g., measles - though this link is debated).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice progressive hearing loss or tinnitus, consult an audiologist and an ENT specialist. Diagnosis involves a hearing test (audiogram - typically shows conductive hearing loss, often with a characteristic 'Carhart's notch' at 2000 Hz on bone conduction), tympanometry (usually normal), and ruling out other causes of conductive hearing loss. A CT scan may sometimes be done.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management options depend on the severity of hearing loss and patient preference.",
      "  - Observation: If hearing loss is mild and not bothersome, no specific treatment may be needed other than regular hearing monitoring.",
      "  - Hearing aids: Very effective for conductive hearing loss caused by otosclerosis, by amplifying sound to overcome the impaired transmission.",
      "  - Surgical treatment (Stapedectomy or Stapedotomy): This is the primary surgical option to restore hearing. It involves removing all or part of the fixed stapes bone and replacing it with a tiny prosthetic device that allows sound vibrations to pass to the inner ear. This surgery has a high success rate in experienced hands but carries small risks (e.g., worsening hearing loss, dizziness, taste disturbance, facial nerve injury - rare).",
      "  - Sodium fluoride supplements: Sometimes suggested in an attempt to slow progression of cochlear otosclerosis, but evidence is limited and use is controversial.",
      "Protect your ears from loud noise exposure, as this can cause additional sensorineural hearing loss unrelated to otosclerosis.",

    "general_advice": "Ovarian cancer is cancer that begins in the ovaries, the female reproductive glands that produce eggs (ova) and hormones like estrogen and progesterone. There are several types of ovarian cancer, classified by the type of cell where they originate: 1) Epithelial ovarian cancer (most common): Arises from cells on the outer surface of the ovary. Subtypes include serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell. 2) Germ cell tumors: Arise from egg-producing cells; more common in younger women, often highly treatable. 3) Stromal cell tumors: Arise from connective tissue cells that produce hormones; rare. Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage because early symptoms are often vague, non-specific, or absent, and there is no effective routine screening test for the general population. When symptoms do occur, they can include: persistent abdominal bloating or swelling, pelvic or abdominal pain or pressure, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary symptoms (urgency or frequency), changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea), fatigue, back pain, pain during intercourse, and unexplained weight loss or gain. Risk factors include: older age, family history of ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer (especially with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations or Lynch syndrome), personal history of breast cancer, endometriosis, never having been pregnant or having first pregnancy late, obesity, and possibly use of fertility drugs or hormone therapy after menopause (though links are complex). Oral contraceptive use is associated with a reduced risk.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent, unexplained symptoms like bloating, pelvic/abdominal pain, or feeling full quickly (especially if new and occurring almost daily for more than a few weeks), consult your doctor or gynecologist. While these symptoms are often due to benign conditions, it's important to rule out ovarian cancer. Diagnosis involves a pelvic exam, transvaginal ultrasound, CT scan or MRI, blood tests (e.g., CA-125 tumor marker - can be elevated in ovarian cancer but also in many benign conditions, so not a reliable screening tool alone), and definitively, surgical exploration with biopsy or removal of suspicious tissue.",

Also, if a known cyst causes acute, severe symptoms.",
    "general_advice": "An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac or pocket that develops on or within an ovary. They are very common, especially during a woman's reproductive years, and many are benign (non-cancerous) and cause no symptoms. Many ovarian cysts are 'functional,' meaning they form as part of the normal menstrual cycle: 1) Follicular cysts: Form when a follicle (sac where an egg develops) doesn't rupture to release the egg but continues to grow. 2) Corpus luteum cysts: Form after an egg is released, if the remaining follicular sac (corpus luteum) fills with fluid or blood. These functional cysts usually disappear on their own within 1-3 menstrual cycles. Other types of benign cysts include: Dermoid cysts (teratomas - can contain various tissues like hair, skin, teeth), Cystadenomas (can be filled with watery or mucousy fluid, can grow large), and Endometriomas ('chocolate cysts' - form from endometrial tissue in endometriosis). Most ovarian cysts are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they can include: dull ache or sharp pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis (often one-sided), feeling of fullness or pressure in abdomen, bloating, pain during intercourse, painful bowel movements, or changes in menstrual cycle (irregular periods, heavier/lighter bleeding). Large cysts can sometimes cause ovarian torsion.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent pelvic pain, bloating, or other concerning symptoms, or if a cyst is found during a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound, consult your doctor or gynecologist. They can determine the type and size of the cyst (usually with a pelvic ultrasound - transvaginal or abdominal) and recommend appropriate management. Blood tests (e.g., CA-125) may be done if there's concern about cancer, especially in postmenopausal women or if cyst has suspicious features, but CA-125 can be elevated in many benign conditions too.",

The pain may be constant or intermittent (if torsion is partial or twists/untwists). Fever may sometimes occur. Delay in treatment can lead to loss of blood supply to the ovary (ischemia), ovarian necrosis (tissue death), infection, and loss of the ovary.",
    "general_advice": "Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary around its supporting ligaments (infundibulopelvic ligament and utero-ovarian ligament), which also contain its blood supply. This twisting can cut off blood flow to the ovary and sometimes the fallopian tube (adnexal torsion). It can occur at any age but is more common during reproductive years. Risk factors that make an ovary more prone to twisting include: presence of an ovarian cyst or tumor (benign or malignant - especially those >5 cm, as they make the ovary heavier and less stable), pregnancy (ovary is enlarged, ligaments are lax), ovulation induction (for fertility treatments, can cause ovarian hyperstimulation and large cysts), previous ovarian torsion, or long ovarian ligaments. Symptoms are often acute and severe (see emergency advice).",

    "general_advice": "Overflow incontinence is a type of urinary incontinence characterized by the involuntary leakage of small amounts of urine from a bladder that is overly full and not emptying properly. It occurs when the bladder muscle (detrusor) is underactive or weak, or when there is a blockage (obstruction) at the bladder outlet that prevents complete emptying. Because the bladder doesn't empty well, it becomes distended, and pressure builds up until it exceeds the urethra's ability to hold back urine, leading to frequent or constant dribbling or leakage. Individuals may also experience a weak or hesitant urine stream, difficulty starting urination, straining to urinate, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, and needing to urinate frequently, including at night (nocturia). Common causes include: 1) Bladder outlet obstruction: e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer in men, urethral strictures, severe pelvic organ prolapse in women. 2) Weak bladder muscle (detrusor underactivity/atony): e.g., due to nerve damage (neurogenic bladder from diabetes, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's), certain medications (e.g., anticholinergics, some antidepressants, muscle relaxants), or chronic overdistension of the bladder.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of overflow incontinence, consult your doctor (primary care or urologist). It's important to identify the underlying cause. Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam (including pelvic/rectal exam), post-void residual (PVR) measurement (to check how much urine is left in bladder after voiding - often high in overflow incontinence), urinalysis, and sometimes urodynamic studies or imaging.",
    "self_care_tips": [

Causes are diverse and can include: 1) Muscle strain or sprain (most common): From poor posture (e.g., 'text neck' from looking down at phones/computers), sleeping in an awkward position, overuse, or minor injuries (e.g., whiplash). 2) Degenerative conditions: Cervical spondylosis (age-related wear and tear/arthritis of neck vertebrae and discs), degenerative disc disease. 3) Nerve compression: Herniated cervical disc or bone spurs (osteophytes) pressing on nerve roots (cervical radiculopathy - causing pain/numbness/weakness radiating into arm/hand) or spinal cord (cervical myelopathy - more widespread neurological symptoms). 4) Injuries: Whiplash, fractures (see separate entry). 5) Other conditions: Rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, meningitis (infection of brain/spinal cord membranes), tumors (rare). Sometimes, pain can be referred from other areas (e.g., shoulder).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Consult a doctor if neck pain is severe, persistent (lasts more than a few weeks despite self-care), recurrent, associated with radiating arm symptoms, or accompanied by neurological deficits or 'red flag' symptoms (see emergency advice). They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate management.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "For mild to moderate acute neck pain (e.g., muscle strain):",
      "  - Rest and activity modification: Avoid activities that worsen pain for a day or two, then gradually resume activity. Avoid prolonged static postures.",
      "  - Ice or heat: Apply cold packs for first 24-48 hours (15-20 minutes at a time) for inflammation, then heat (heating pad, warm shower/bath) may be more soothing for muscle soreness/stiffness.",
      "  - Over-the-counter pain relievers: Acetaminophen, NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), or topical pain relievers.",
      "  - Gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises for the neck (as pain allows, e.g., slowly tilting head side to side, ear to shoulder, chin to chest). Avoid forceful or jerky movements.",
      "  - Maintain good posture: When sitting, standing, and using computers/phones. Ensure ergonomic setup of workstation.",
      "  - Use a supportive pillow for sleeping that keeps neck in a neutral alignment (avoid sleeping on stomach).",
      "  - Manage stress, as it can contribute to muscle tension.",
      "Physical therapy can be very helpful for many types of neck pain, providing exercises, manual therapy, and education on posture/ergonomics.",
      "Medical treatments (if conservative measures fail) may include: prescription medications (muscle relaxants, stronger pain relievers, neuropathic pain drugs), trigger point injections, epidural steroid injections, or rarely, surgery for specific conditions like severe herniated disc or spinal cord compression."

    "general_advice": "Pancreatic cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and hormones like insulin. The most common type (about 90%) is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which arises from cells lining the pancreatic ducts. Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (PNETs or islet cell tumors) are less common and often have a better prognosis. Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage because early symptoms are often vague, non-specific, or absent, and it tends to be aggressive and spread early. Symptoms, when they occur, can include: abdominal pain (often in upper abdomen, may radiate to back, can be dull or gnawing, sometimes worse after eating or when lying down), unexplained significant weight loss, loss of appetite, jaundice (if tumor blocks bile duct - causing yellow skin/eyes, dark urine, pale stools, itching), changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, oily/greasy stools - steatorrhea if pancreatic enzymes are blocked), nausea, vomiting, new-onset diabetes (especially in older adults with weight loss), fatigue, and depression. Risk factors include: smoking (major risk factor), obesity, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes (long-standing type 2, or new-onset), family history of pancreatic cancer or certain genetic syndromes (e.g., BRCA mutations, Lynch syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), older age, and possibly high intake of red/processed meats or heavy alcohol use.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent, unexplained symptoms suggestive of pancreatic cancer, especially jaundice, significant weight loss, or new-onset abdominal/back pain, consult your doctor promptly. Diagnosis involves imaging (CT scan, MRI/MRCP, endoscopic ultrasound - EUS), blood tests (liver function, tumor markers like CA 19-9 - not specific enough for screening but can be useful for monitoring), and often a biopsy (e.g., via EUS or CT-guided) to confirm cancer and determine type.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment depends on the type, stage, location of the cancer, and patient's overall health. It's managed by a multidisciplinary team (surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, gastroenterologist, palliative care specialist).",
      "  - Surgery: The only potentially curative option, but only possible if cancer is localized and resectable (e.g., Whipple procedure - pancreaticoduodenectomy, or distal pancreatectomy). Many are unresectable at diagnosis.",
      "  - Chemotherapy: Often used before surgery (neoadjuvant), after surgery (adjuvant), or as primary treatment for advanced/metastatic disease. Common regimens include FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based combinations.",
      "  - Radiation therapy: May be used with chemotherapy (chemoradiation), especially for locally advanced, unresectable tumors, or for palliative symptom relief.",
      "  - Targeted therapy or immunotherapy: Options for a small subset of patients with specific genetic mutations or biomarkers.",
      "  - Palliative care and symptom management are crucial throughout the course of illness: Pain control (can be severe), management of jaundice (e.g., biliary stenting), pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) if exocrine insufficiency, nutritional support (dietitian consultation, supplements, sometimes feeding tubes), management of diabetes, and psychosocial support.",
      "Quit smoking.",
      "Maintain best possible nutrition and hydration.",
      "Seek emotional and psychological support (counseling, support groups) for patient and family. Pancreatic cancer has a challenging prognosis."

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you are unsure if it's a panic attack or a medical emergency, especially if you have: severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, feeling of choking, fainting, or if it's your first severe attack. Also, if panic attacks are leading to suicidal thoughts or inability to function.",
    "general_advice": "A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes and is accompanied by a range of physical and psychological symptoms. These attacks can occur unexpectedly (out of the blue) or can be cued by specific situations or triggers. Symptoms can include: palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; sweating; trembling or shaking; sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; feeling of choking; chest pain or discomfort; nausea or abdominal distress; feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; chills or heat sensations; paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); fear of losing control or 'going crazy'; and fear of dying. Panic attacks can be very frightening and can lead to avoidance of situations where attacks have occurred or where escape might be difficult.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience panic attacks, especially if they are recurrent, unexpected, or causing significant distress or impairment (e.g., leading to avoidance behaviors or development of Panic Disorder - see separate entry), consult a doctor or mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist).

    "general_advice": "Parasitic disease is an infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasite. A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. There are three main classes of parasites that can cause disease in humans: 1) Protozoa: Microscopic, single-celled organisms (e.g., Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica - causing intestinal infections; Plasmodium - causing malaria; Toxoplasma gondii - causing toxoplasmosis; Trypanosomes - causing African sleeping sickness or Chagas disease). 2) Helminths: Multicellular parasitic worms (e.g., roundworms like Ascaris, hookworms, pinworms; tapeworms like Taenia; flukes like Schistosoma). 3) Ectoparasites: Organisms that live on the skin (e.g., lice, scabies mites, ticks, fleas). Parasitic diseases are a major public health problem worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation and hygiene. Transmission can occur through contaminated food or water, insect vectors (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks), direct contact, or penetration of skin. Symptoms are extremely diverse depending on the parasite, site of infection, and host immune response, ranging from asymptomatic to mild digestive upset, skin rashes, to severe, life-threatening systemic illness.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect a parasitic infection, especially if you have traveled to or live in an endemic area, or have relevant exposures and develop symptoms (e.g., persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, unexplained fever, skin lesions, fatigue, weight loss), consult your doctor (primary care, infectious disease specialist, or travel medicine specialist). Diagnosis involves identifying the parasite or its eggs/cysts in stool, blood, tissue samples, or through serological tests (for antibodies) or molecular tests (PCR).",

Also, if there are complications like pathological fractures due to severe bone disease.",
    "general_advice": "A parathyroid adenoma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor of one (most commonly) or more of the parathyroid glands. Humans typically have four small parathyroid glands located in the neck, behind or near the thyroid gland. These glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which plays a key role in regulating calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bones. A parathyroid adenoma causes the affected gland(s) to become overactive and produce too much PTH, leading to primary hyperparathyroidism. This results in high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) and often low or inappropriately normal blood phosphorus levels. Most parathyroid adenomas are sporadic (occur by chance), but they can rarely be part of genetic syndromes (e.g., Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia - MEN). Many people with mild primary hyperparathyroidism due to an adenoma have no symptoms, and it's found incidentally on routine blood tests. When symptoms do occur (often due to chronic hypercalcemia), they can be remembered by 'stones, bones, groans, and psychiatric overtones': Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), Bone pain, osteoporosis, fractures, Abdominal groans (constipation, nausea, vomiting, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis), and Psychiatric overtones (fatigue, weakness, depression, anxiety, memory problems, confusion, lethargy). Other symptoms can include excessive thirst and urination, and high blood pressure.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of hyperparathyroidism or if high calcium/PTH levels are found on blood tests, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist/endocrine surgeon). Diagnosis involves blood tests (calcium, PTH, vitamin D, phosphorus, kidney function), urine tests (24-hour urine calcium), bone density scan (DXA), and imaging to locate the adenoma(s) (e.g., parathyroid ultrasound, sestamibi scan, 4D-CT scan).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment depends on the severity of hyperparathyroidism, symptoms, and presence of complications.",
      "  - Surgical removal of the affected parathyroid gland(s) (parathyroidectomy): This is the primary and usually curative treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism or for asymptomatic individuals who meet certain criteria (e.g., very high calcium, significant bone loss, kidney stones, young age). Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) is often possible if the adenoma is localized preoperatively.",
      "  - Observation ('watchful waiting'): For individuals with mild, asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism who don't meet criteria for surgery, regular monitoring of calcium levels, kidney function, and bone density may be an option.",
      "  - Medications: Cinacalcet (a calcimimetic) can lower PTH and calcium levels and may be used for some patients who are not surgical candidates or have parathyroid carcinoma (rare). Bisphosphonates may be used to treat osteoporosis.",
      "Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids (helps prevent kidney stones).",
      "Ensure adequate (but not excessive) calcium and vitamin D intake through diet, as per doctor's advice (paradoxically, severe restriction can sometimes stimulate PTH further).",

Also, if there are thoughts of self-harm or suicide due to depression or distress from the disease.",
    "general_advice": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects dopamine-producing neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter crucial for controlling movement, as well as mood and motivation. The loss of these dopamine cells leads to the characteristic motor (movement-related) symptoms of PD. Key motor symptoms include: 1) Tremor: Often a resting tremor (shaking that occurs when limb is at rest, may improve with movement), commonly starting in one hand or fingers ('pill-rolling' tremor). 2) Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement, difficulty initiating movement. 3) Rigidity: Stiffness of limbs, neck, or trunk. 4) Postural instability: Impaired balance and coordination, leading to increased risk of falls (usually a later symptom). Other motor symptoms can include shuffling gait, freezing of gait, masked facies (reduced facial expression), micrographia (small handwriting), and speech changes (soft, monotone voice - hypophonia). PD also involves non-motor symptoms, which can be very bothersome and may precede motor symptoms. These include: loss of smell (anosmia), sleep disturbances (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder - acting out dreams, insomnia), constipation, depression, anxiety, fatigue, cognitive impairment (e.g., problems with attention, executive function, memory - can progress to Parkinson's disease dementia in later stages), and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, urinary problems, sweating abnormalities). The exact cause of PD is unknown, but involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Age is a major risk factor.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop symptoms suggestive of Parkinson's disease, consult a doctor (primary care or neurologist, preferably one specializing in movement disorders). Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on medical history, neurological exam (assessing for characteristic motor signs), and response to dopaminergic medication. There is no definitive blood test or imaging scan to diagnose PD, though imaging (e.g., MRI, DaTscan) may be used to rule out other conditions or support diagnosis in some cases.",

It can be acute (sudden onset, often painful, usually bacterial - e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*) or chronic (develops gradually, lasts longer, often due to mixed infection with fungi like Candida and bacteria, or irritant exposure). Acute paronychia often results from minor trauma to the nail fold (e.g., nail biting, hangnails, manicures/pedicures, ingrown nails, finger sucking in children). Chronic paronychia is more common in people whose hands or feet are frequently wet or exposed to irritants/allergens (e.g., dishwashers, bartenders, healthcare workers). Symptoms of acute paronychia include: redness, swelling, pain, and tenderness of the skin around the nail. A pus-filled blister (abscess) may form.

If you have underlying heart disease, PSVT can be more serious.",
    "general_advice": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) characterized by episodes of a very rapid but regular heartbeat that start and stop abruptly ('paroxysmal'). 'Supraventricular' means the arrhythmia originates above the ventricles (lower heart chambers), typically in the atria or AV node. The heart rate during PSVT is usually between 140 and 250 beats per minute. It's caused by an abnormality in the heart's electrical conduction system, often involving an extra electrical pathway or a re-entrant circuit (where electrical signals travel in a loop). Common types include atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT - most common) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT - involves an accessory pathway, e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). Symptoms during an episode can include: palpitations (sensation of a rapid, forceful, or fluttering heartbeat), dizziness or lightheadedness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort or tightness, anxiety, and sometimes fatigue or fainting.

    "emergency_advice": "Ventricular tachycardia is a serious, potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. Seek immediate emergency medical attention (call 911, 999, 112) if you experience symptoms of VT: palpitations (rapid, often forceful heartbeat), dizziness or lightheadedness, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, fainting (syncope), or if you feel very unwell. Sustained VT can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (a chaotic, ineffective quivering of ventricles), which causes sudden cardiac arrest if not treated immediately with defibrillation.",
    "general_advice": "Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (VT or V-tach) is a type of arrhythmia characterized by episodes of a very rapid heartbeat (usually >100-120 beats per minute, often 150-250 bpm) that originate in the ventricles (lower chambers of the heart). 'Paroxysmal' means it starts and stops suddenly. VT can be non-sustained (lasts <30 seconds) or sustained (lasts >30 seconds or causes hemodynamic collapse). It occurs when abnormal electrical signals in the ventricles cause them to beat too quickly and out of sync with the atria. This rapid ventricular rate can prevent the heart from pumping blood effectively to the brain and body. VT is often associated with underlying structural heart disease (e.g., coronary artery disease, previous heart attack/scar tissue, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, valvular heart disease), but can also occur due to electrolyte imbalances (especially low potassium or magnesium), certain medications (proarrhythmic effects), inherited heart rhythm disorders (e.g., long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), or rarely in structurally normal hearts (idiopathic VT).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of VT, it's an emergency. If diagnosed, ongoing management by a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is essential. Diagnosis involves an EKG (during an episode is diagnostic), Holter monitor, event recorder, stress test, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, coronary angiography, or electrophysiology study (EPS) to assess risk and guide treatment.",

    "general_advice": "A pelvic fistula is an abnormal opening or tunnel that connects two or more organs or spaces within the pelvis, or connects a pelvic organ to the skin. Common types in women include: 1) Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF): Between the bladder and vagina, causing continuous leakage of urine into the vagina. 2) Rectovaginal fistula (RVF): Between the rectum and vagina, causing leakage of stool or gas from the vagina. 3) Ureterovaginal fistula: Between a ureter (tube from kidney to bladder) and vagina, causing urine leakage. 4) Enterovaginal fistula: Between intestine and vagina. 5) Vesicouterine fistula: Between bladder and uterus. Causes of pelvic fistulas include: childbirth trauma (prolonged or obstructed labor - a major cause in developing countries, often leading to obstetric fistula), pelvic surgery (e.g., hysterectomy, C-section, rectal surgery), radiation therapy to the pelvis (for cancer), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cancer (e.g., cervical, rectal, bladder cancer invading adjacent organs), or trauma. Symptoms depend on the type and location of fistula but often involve abnormal leakage of urine, stool, or gas from the vagina or skin, recurrent urinary tract infections, vaginal irritation or infections, and sometimes pain or foul odor. Fistulas can cause significant physical discomfort and psychosocial distress.",

PID can be a serious infection requiring prompt treatment to prevent long-term complications.",
    "general_advice": "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection and inflammation of the female upper genital tract, including the uterus (endometritis), fallopian tubes (salpingitis), ovaries (oophoritis), and sometimes surrounding pelvic structures (pelvic peritonitis). It's usually caused by bacteria ascending from the vagina and cervix, most commonly from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia and gonorrhea. However, other bacteria normally found in the vagina can also cause PID, especially after procedures that disrupt the cervical barrier (e.g., IUD insertion, childbirth, miscarriage, abortion). Symptoms can range from mild or absent to severe. Common symptoms include: lower abdominal or pelvic pain (can be dull, cramping, or sharp), abnormal vaginal discharge (often with a foul odor, may be yellowish or greenish), abnormal uterine bleeding (e.g., bleeding between periods, after intercourse, heavier periods), pain or bleeding during intercourse (dyspareunia), fever and chills, and painful or frequent urination. Untreated or inadequately treated PID can lead to serious long-term complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility (due to scarring/blockage of fallopian tubes), ectopic pregnancy, and tubo-ovarian abscess.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience any symptoms of PID, consult your doctor or gynecologist immediately. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications. Diagnosis is often based on clinical findings (pelvic exam showing cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness), and may be supported by tests for STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea), white blood cell count, inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), ultrasound (to look for tubo-ovarian abscess or other pelvic pathology), or rarely, laparoscopy.",

    "general_advice": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a condition where one or more of the pelvic organs (bladder, uterus, vagina, small bowel, or rectum) drop (prolapse) from their normal position and bulge or protrude into or out of the vagina. This occurs when the muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor, which support these organs, become weakened or damaged. Common types include: 1) Cystocele (prolapsed bladder, 'anterior prolapse'): Bladder bulges into front wall of vagina. 2) Rectocele (prolapsed rectum, 'posterior prolapse'): Rectum bulges into back wall of vagina. 3) Uterine prolapse: Uterus drops down into vagina. 4) Vaginal vault prolapse: Top of vagina drops down after hysterectomy. 5) Enterocele: Small intestine bulges into top part of vagina. Risk factors include: childbirth (especially multiple vaginal deliveries, large babies, forceps/vacuum delivery), aging and menopause (due to estrogen loss affecting tissue strength), obesity, chronic constipation or straining, chronic cough (e.g., from smoking or lung disease), heavy lifting, previous pelvic surgery (e.g., hysterectomy), and genetic factors affecting connective tissue. Symptoms can vary depending on the type and severity of prolapse but may include: a feeling of pressure, fullness, heaviness, or bulging in the vagina or pelvis (may feel like 'something is falling out'); a visible bulge or protrusion from the vagina; urinary problems (e.g., stress incontinence - leaking with cough/sneeze, urge incontinence, incomplete bladder emptying, recurrent UTIs); bowel problems (e.g., constipation, difficulty evacuating stool - may need to splint/press on vagina to have BM, fecal incontinence); pain or discomfort during intercourse (dyspareunia); and low back pain. Symptoms often worsen with prolonged standing or at end of day.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, consult your doctor (gynecologist, urogyn.ecologist, or urologist).

    "general_advice": "Pemphigus is a group of rare, chronic autoimmune blistering diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes (e.g., mouth, throat, nose, eyes, genitals). In pemphigus, the immune system produces autoantibodies that attack desmogleins, which are proteins responsible for cell-to-cell adhesion in the epidermis (outer layer of skin) and mucous membranes. This causes skin cells to separate from each other (acantholysis), leading to the formation of fragile, flaccid (soft, easily ruptured) blisters and erosions (raw, open sores). The two main types are: 1) Pemphigus vulgaris (PV - most common and often most severe): Typically starts with painful blisters and erosions in the mouth, which can precede skin lesions by weeks or months. Skin blisters are usually soft, easily ruptured (leaving painful erosions), and can occur anywhere on the body. Nikolsky's sign (gentle rubbing of normal-appearing skin causes blistering or separation of epidermis) is often positive. 2) Pemphigus foliaceus (PF): Milder form, usually affects only the skin (rarely mucous membranes). Blisters are more superficial, crusted, and scaly, often on scalp, face, chest, and back. Itching can be prominent. Other rarer forms exist (e.g., paraneoplastic pemphigus - associated with cancer; IgA pemphigus). Pemphigus is not contagious.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop persistent blisters or sores on your skin or in your mouth/other mucous membranes, consult a doctor or dermatologist immediately. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to control the disease, promote healing, and prevent complications. Diagnosis involves a skin biopsy (for histology and direct immunofluorescence - DIF, to detect autoantibodies in skin) and blood tests (for circulating autoantibodies - indirect immunofluorescence - IIF, or ELISA for anti-desmoglein antibodies).",

    "general_advice": "Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the thin, sac-like membrane that surrounds the heart. The pericardium normally contains a small amount of lubricating fluid. When it becomes inflamed, it can cause chest pain and sometimes lead to fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac (pericardial effusion). Causes of pericarditis can be: 1) Idiopathic (unknown cause - most common). 2) Viral infections (e.g., coxsackievirus, echovirus, influenza, HIV - common infectious cause). 3) Bacterial or fungal infections (less common, more serious). 4) Autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma). 5) Post-myocardial infarction (heart attack) - Dressler's syndrome. 6) Post-cardiac surgery. 7) Kidney failure (uremic pericarditis). 8) Trauma to chest or heart. 9) Cancer (e.g., metastatic, or primary pericardial tumors - rare). 10) Certain medications. The hallmark symptom is sharp, stabbing chest pain, often located in the center or left side of the chest, which may radiate to the shoulder, neck, or arm. The pain is typically worse when lying down, taking a deep breath, or coughing, and may be relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Other symptoms can include fever, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dry cough, and palpitations.

It's usually caused by atherosclerosis (buildup of fatty plaques in arteries), the same process that causes coronary artery disease and carotid artery disease. Reduced blood flow can lead to various symptoms, especially during physical activity when muscles need more oxygen. The most common symptom is intermittent claudication: cramping pain or aching in the leg muscles (calves, thighs, or buttocks) that is triggered by exercise (like walking) and relieved by a few minutes of rest. Other symptoms can include: leg numbness or weakness, coldness in the lower leg or foot (especially compared to other side), sores or ulcers on toes, feet, or legs that heal slowly or not at all, changes in skin color of legs/feet (pale, bluish, or shiny), hair loss or slow hair growth on legs/feet, slow toenail growth, diminished or absent pulses in legs/feet, and in severe cases, rest pain (pain in feet/toes even when not walking, often worse at night when legs are elevated, relieved by dangling legs over side of bed) or critical limb ischemia (CLI - rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene, high risk of amputation).

    "general_advice": "Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for damage or dysfunction of peripheral nerves, which are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord that transmit signals between the central nervous system and the rest of the body (muscles, skin, internal organs). It can affect sensory nerves (causing numbness, tingling, pain, loss of sensation to touch/temperature/pain), motor nerves (causing muscle weakness, cramps, twitching, paralysis, difficulty with coordination/balance), and/or autonomic nerves (causing problems with blood pressure regulation, digestion, bladder function, sweating). Neuropathy can be classified by the number of nerves affected (mononeuropathy - one nerve, e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome; mononeuritis multiplex - multiple individual nerves; polyneuropathy - many nerves, often symmetrically, typically starting in feet/hands - 'stocking-glove' pattern). There are numerous causes, including: Diabetes (most common cause of polyneuropathy), Vitamin deficiencies (B12, B6, B1, E), Alcohol abuse, Toxins (heavy metals, industrial chemicals), Medications (chemotherapy, certain antibiotics, etc. - see Drug-Induced Neuropathy), Infections (Lyme disease, HIV, shingles, leprosy), Autoimmune diseases (Guillain-Barré syndrome, CIDP, vasculitis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), Inherited/genetic neuropathies (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), Trauma or compression of nerves, Kidney disease, Liver disease, Hypothyroidism, or Idiopathic (unknown cause).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in your hands, feet, or elsewhere, consult your doctor (primary care or neurologist). Diagnosis involves a thorough medical history, neurological exam, blood tests (to check for underlying causes like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid/kidney/liver function, autoimmune markers), and often nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) to assess nerve and muscle function. Sometimes a nerve biopsy or skin biopsy may be done.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends on the underlying cause and aims to treat it if possible, relieve symptoms, and prevent further nerve damage.",
      "  - Treat the underlying cause: e.g., strict blood sugar control in diabetes, vitamin supplementation for deficiencies, immunosuppressants for autoimmune neuropathies, avoiding toxins/offending drugs.",
      "  - Pain management for neuropathic pain: Medications like gabapentin, pregabalin, certain antidepressants (amitriptyline, duloxetine), topical treatments (lidocaine, capsaicin). Opioids are generally used cautiously.",

A deep or rapidly spreading infection, or an abscess needing urgent drainage, requires prompt care. Fournier's gangrene (a rare, severe necrotizing infection of perineum) is a life-threatening emergency.",
    "general_advice": "Perirectal infection refers to an infection in the tissues around the rectum and anus. This often manifests as: 1) Perirectal or Perianal Abscess: A localized collection of pus in the tissues near the anus or rectum. It usually results from an infection of an anal gland (small glands just inside the anus). Symptoms include: constant, throbbing pain (often worse with sitting or bowel movements), tenderness, swelling, redness, and warmth in the perianal area. A palpable lump may be present. Fever and malaise can also occur. 2) Fistula-in-Ano (Anal Fistula - see separate entry): An abnormal tunnel that forms between an infected anal gland (often the site of a previous abscess) and an opening on the skin near the anus. Can cause persistent or recurrent pain, swelling, and discharge of pus or bloody fluid. Risk factors for perirectal infections include: Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, trauma, previous perianal surgery, diabetes, weakened immune system, or anal intercourse.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of a perirectal abscess (pain, swelling, redness, fever) or fistula (persistent discharge), consult your doctor (primary care, colorectal surgeon, or proctologist) promptly.

    "general_advice": "Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin, serous membrane that lines the inside of the abdominal wall and covers most of the abdominal organs. It's usually caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can occur due to: 1) Perforation (rupture or hole) of an abdominal organ: e.g., ruptured appendix (appendicitis), perforated peptic ulcer, perforated diverticulum (diverticulitis), ruptured gallbladder, bowel perforation (from obstruction, ischemia, trauma, or IBD). This allows bacteria or digestive contents to leak into the normally sterile peritoneal cavity. 2) Complication of medical procedures: e.g., peritoneal dialysis (PD-associated peritonitis), abdominal surgery, paracentesis. 3) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): An infection of ascitic fluid (fluid buildup in abdomen) in people with advanced liver disease/cirrhosis, without an obvious source of perforation. 4) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) spreading into abdomen. 5) Trauma to abdomen. Peritonitis can rapidly lead to sepsis, shock, organ failure, and death if not treated urgently.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if peritonitis is suspected. Diagnosis involves a physical exam (abdominal rigidity/tenderness are key signs), blood tests (CBC for high white cell count, blood cultures), imaging (X-rays or CT scan of abdomen to look for free air/fluid, source of infection, or complications), and sometimes analysis of peritoneal fluid (if ascites is present or obtained via paracentesis or during surgery).",

Difficulty breathing is an emergency.",
    "general_advice": "A peritonsillar abscess (PTA), also known as quinsy, is a collection of pus that forms in the tissues around one of the tonsils (usually just behind or next to it). It's typically a complication of acute tonsillitis (infection of the tonsils), often bacterial (e.g., Group A Streptococcus, other oral bacteria). The infection spreads from the tonsil into the surrounding peritonsillar space. PTA is more common in older children, adolescents, and young adults. Symptoms usually start with a severe sore throat that is often unilateral (worse on one side). Other symptoms include: fever, malaise, difficulty and pain when swallowing (can be severe, leading to drooling as saliva can't be swallowed), muffled voice, trismus (difficulty opening mouth), ear pain on the affected side (referred pain), bad breath (halitosis), and sometimes swelling on one side of the neck or visible bulging/asymmetry in the back of the throat (uvula may be deviated away from affected side).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect a peritonsillar abscess, see a doctor (primary care, ENT specialist, or ER) immediately. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical exam (looking at the throat).

    "general_advice": "Persistent vomiting refers to ongoing or recurrent episodes of vomiting that last for an extended period (e.g., more than 24-48 hours, or occurring frequently over days/weeks) without a readily identifiable cause. Vomiting is a forceful expulsion of stomach contents and is a symptom, not a disease itself. There are numerous potential causes of persistent vomiting, ranging from relatively benign to serious, including: Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., viral or bacterial gastroenteritis - though usually acute, can sometimes be prolonged; food poisoning; peptic ulcers; gastritis; gastroparesis; bowel obstruction; inflammatory bowel disease; appendicitis; pancreatitis; gallbladder disease), Neurological conditions (e.g., migraine, increased intracranial pressure from tumor/bleed/hydrocephalus, motion sickness, labyrinthitis), Metabolic/Endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, adrenal insufficiency, uremia from kidney failure, hypercalcemia, thyroid disorders), Medications (many drugs can cause nausea/vomiting as a side effect), Pregnancy (morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum), Infections outside GI tract (e.g., UTI, pneumonia), Psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, bulimia, cyclic vomiting syndrome), or Toxins/Poisons. When the cause is not apparent after initial assessment, it's termed 'of unknown cause' pending further investigation.",

    "general_advice": "A personality disorder is a type of mental disorder characterized by enduring, inflexible, and maladaptive patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that deviate markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, are pervasive and stable over time, and lead to significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. These patterns often begin in adolescence or early adulthood. There are 10 specific personality disorders recognized in the DSM-5, grouped into three clusters: Cluster A (Odd, Eccentric): Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal. Cluster B (Dramatic, Emotional, Erratic): Antisocial, Borderline (BPD), Histrionic, Narcissistic (NPD). Cluster C (Anxious, Fearful): Avoidant, Dependent, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD - different from OCD). Individuals with personality disorders often have difficulty perceiving and relating to situations and people, leading to problems in relationships, work, and social settings. They may not recognize that their thoughts and behaviors are problematic (poor insight) and may blame others for their difficulties. Causes are thought to involve a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, early life experiences (e.g., trauma, neglect, unstable upbringing), and brain development/chemistry.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or someone you know exhibits long-standing, problematic patterns of behavior, thinking, and relating that cause significant distress or impairment, encourage them to consult a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist).

    "general_advice": "Peyronie's disease is a condition characterized by the development of fibrous scar tissue (plaques) inside the penis, within the tunica albuginea (the tough, fibrous sheath surrounding the erectile tissue). These plaques can cause the penis to bend or curve during an erection, and may also lead to: pain during erections or intercourse, shortening or narrowing of the penis, palpable lumps or hard areas in the penis, and erectile dysfunction (difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection). The exact cause is often unknown, but it's thought to result from repeated minor trauma or injury to the penis (e.g., during sexual activity or accidents), leading to abnormal wound healing and scar tissue formation. Genetic factors, aging, and certain connective tissue disorders may also play a role. Peyronie's disease often occurs in two phases: 1) Acute phase (inflammatory phase): Can last for 6-18 months. Characterized by pain (with or without erections), plaque formation, and development/worsening of penile curvature. 2) Chronic phase (stable phase): Pain usually subsides, plaque and curvature stabilize, and erectile dysfunction may become more prominent.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a bend or curve in your erect penis, palpable lumps, pain, or other symptoms suggestive of Peyronie's disease, consult a doctor, preferably a urologist specializing in men's sexual health. Diagnosis is usually based on medical history and physical exam (palpation of plaques). An ultrasound or other imaging may be done, sometimes after inducing an erection in the office (e.g., with an injection), to assess plaque size, location, and degree of curvature.",

    "general_advice": "Pharyngitis, commonly known as a sore throat, is an inflammation of the pharynx, which is the part of the throat behind the mouth and nasal cavity, and above the esophagus and larynx (voice box). It's a very common symptom. Most sore throats (about 80-90%) are caused by viral infections, such as those that cause the common cold or flu. Bacterial infections are less common but can be more serious; the most common bacterial cause is Group A Streptococcus (*Streptococcus pyogenes*), which causes strep throat. Other causes of sore throat can include: allergies (e.g., postnasal drip irritating throat), dry air, irritants (smoke, pollution, chemicals), vocal strain (yelling, excessive talking), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD - stomach acid irritating throat), and rarely, more serious conditions like tumors or abscesses. Symptoms of pharyngitis include: throat pain or scratchiness (often worse when swallowing), redness and swelling in the back of the throat, and sometimes fever, headache, body aches, swollen lymph nodes in neck, or rash (e.g., in scarlet fever, associated with strep throat). Viral sore throats often occur with other cold/flu symptoms (runny nose, cough, sneezing). Strep throat is more likely to cause sudden severe sore throat, painful swallowing, fever, red tonsils with white patches (exudate), tiny red spots on roof of mouth (petechiae), and swollen neck glands, often without cough/runny nose.",

    "general_advice": "Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin (prepuce) of the penis is too tight to be retracted (pulled back) over the glans (head of the penis). It can be: 1) Physiological phimosis: Normal in uncircumcised newborn boys and young children. The foreskin is naturally adherent to the glans at birth and gradually becomes retractable over time, usually by age 3-5, but can take longer (into adolescence for some). This is not a problem unless it causes issues. 2) Pathological phimosis: Develops later in life in boys or men who previously had a retractable foreskin, or persists beyond childhood. It's often due to scarring, inflammation, or infection of the foreskin (e.g., from recurrent balanoposthitis, lichen sclerosus - a chronic skin condition, or trauma). Pathological phimosis can cause problems like: difficulty with urination (e.g., ballooning of foreskin during urination, weak stream), pain during erections or intercourse, recurrent infections under the foreskin (balanoposthitis), increased risk of paraphimosis, and difficulty with hygiene.",

This can lead to inflammation, infection, and the formation of a cyst or abscess (a collection of pus). The cyst may contain hair, skin debris, and fluid. Risk factors include: being male (more common), young adulthood (often late teens to 20s), having a lot of body hair (especially coarse, stiff hair), deep natal cleft, prolonged sitting (e.g., 'jeep seat disease'), obesity, family history, and local trauma or irritation. Many pilonidal sinuses are asymptomatic or cause only mild discomfort. If it becomes infected (pilonidal abscess), symptoms can include: pain (can be severe), swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness in the natal cleft area; drainage of pus or bloody fluid (may be foul-smelling) from one or more small openings (sinus pits) in the skin; and sometimes fever.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of a pilonidal cyst or abscess, consult your doctor (primary care or a surgeon, often a colorectal or general surgeon). Diagnosis is usually based on physical exam. Treatment depends on whether it's an acute abscess or a chronic/recurrent sinus.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "For an acute pilonidal abscess:",
      "  - Incision and drainage (I&D) by a doctor is usually necessary to relieve pain and drain pus. Antibiotics may also be prescribed, especially if cellulitis is present.",
      "  - After I&D, warm soaks or sitz baths can help with comfort and promote further drainage. Keep the area clean and follow doctor's instructions for wound care/packing if needed.",
      "For chronic or recurrent pilonidal sinus disease:",
      "  - Maintain good hygiene of the natal cleft area: Wash daily with mild soap and water, dry thoroughly.",
      "  - Keep the area free of loose hairs: Regular shaving or hair removal (e.g., depilatory creams, laser hair removal) in the natal cleft may help prevent recurrence for some, but discuss with doctor as it can sometimes cause irritation.",
      "  - Avoid prolonged sitting and try to reduce pressure on the area (e.g., use a coccyx cushion).",
      "  - Weight loss if obese.",
      "  - If sinus tracts are chronically draining or causing recurrent infections, surgical excision of the sinus tracts is often recommended. Various surgical techniques exist (e.g., simple excision, excision with primary closure, flap procedures like Karydakis or Bascom flap). Recurrence can still occur after surgery.",
      "  - Less invasive options (e.g., phenol injection, laser ablation of tracts) are being explored."

This is to rule out other conditions or complications like severe pingueculitis or development of a pterygium that might affect vision.",
    "general_advice": "A pinguecula (plural: pingueculae) is a common, benign (non-cancerous) degenerative condition of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye (sclera). It appears as a yellowish, slightly raised, fleshy-looking bump or patch, typically on the nasal side (inner corner) or temporal side (outer corner) of the cornea, within the interpalpebral fissure (the part of the eye exposed when eyelids are open). It does not grow onto the cornea itself (unlike a pterygium). Pingueculae are thought to be caused by chronic exposure to sun (UV radiation), wind, dust, and dry environments. They are more common in middle-aged or older individuals and those who spend a lot of time outdoors. Most pingueculae are asymptomatic or cause only mild symptoms like: occasional eye irritation, dryness, redness (if it becomes inflamed - pingueculitis), a gritty or foreign body sensation, or cosmetic concern. They do not usually affect vision.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a yellowish bump on the white of your eye, or if a known pinguecula becomes inflamed, irritated, or bothersome, consult an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.

    "general_advice": "Pinworm infection (enterobiasis or oxyuriasis) is a common intestinal parasitic infection caused by a small, thin, white roundworm called *Enterobius vermicularis*. It's most common in school-aged children, but can affect people of all ages, especially in crowded living conditions or households with infected individuals. The infection occurs when pinworm eggs are ingested. Female pinworms migrate out of the anus, usually at night, to lay thousands of microscopic eggs on the skin around the anal area. This causes the hallmark symptom: intense itching around the anus (pruritus ani), especially at night, which can disrupt sleep. Other symptoms can include restlessness, irritability, and sometimes mild abdominal pain or nausea, though many infections are asymptomatic. Scratching the itchy area can transfer eggs to fingers and under fingernails, leading to re-infection (autoinoculation) or spread to others through contaminated hands, clothing, bedding, food, or surfaces. Pinworms are not usually a serious health threat but can be very bothersome.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has symptoms of pinworm infection (especially anal itching at night), consult your doctor. Diagnosis can often be made by identifying adult worms in the perianal area (visible at night or early morning) or by a 'tape test' (pressing clear adhesive tape to the skin around the anus in the morning before bathing/bowel movement, then examining the tape under a microscope for eggs). Treatment with medication is usually effective.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Medication (prescribed by doctor or sometimes available over-the-counter, depending on region): Anthelmintic drugs like mebendazole, albendazole, or pyrantel pamoate are used to treat pinworm infection. Usually, a single dose is given, followed by a second dose 2 weeks later to kill any newly hatched worms from ingested eggs (as medication kills adult worms but not always eggs). It's often recommended to treat all household members at the same time, even if asymptomatic, to prevent reinfection and spread.",
      "Hygiene measures are crucial to eliminate eggs and prevent reinfection/spread (continue for at least 2 weeks after treatment):",
      "  - Wash hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water, especially after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before preparing/eating food.",
      "  - Keep fingernails trimmed short to reduce egg accumulation under nails.",
      "  - Discourage scratching the anal area and nail biting.",
      "  - Bathe or shower daily in the morning to wash away eggs from perianal skin.",
      "  - Change underwear, pajamas, and bedding daily (especially for first few days after treatment). Wash these items in hot water and dry on high heat.",
      "  - Clean and vacuum the house regularly, especially bedrooms, to remove eggs from surfaces (eggs can survive for 2-3 weeks in environment).",
      "  - Avoid shaking bedding or clothing to prevent dispersing eggs into the air.",

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention for acute complications of a pituitary adenoma: sudden, severe headache with vision loss, double vision, or altered mental status (could be pituitary apoplexy - bleeding into or impaired blood supply to the tumor, a neurosurgical emergency); or severe symptoms related to acute hormone excess/deficiency (e.g., adrenal crisis if ACTH production is suddenly lost, severe electrolyte imbalance from DI if ADH affected, or cardiovascular issues from acute excess of GH or ACTH).",
    "general_advice": "A pituitary adenoma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor that arises from cells in the pituitary gland, a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland is often called the 'master gland' as it produces and regulates many important hormones that control various bodily functions (e.g., growth, metabolism, stress response, reproduction, lactation, fluid balance). Pituitary adenomas can be: 1) Functioning (hormone-secreting): Produce excess amounts of one or more pituitary hormones, leading to specific endocrine syndromes. Examples include: Prolactinoma (excess prolactin - causing galactorrhea, irregular periods/infertility in women, decreased libido/erectile dysfunction in men), Cushing's disease (excess ACTH leading to excess cortisol), Acromegaly/Gigantism (excess growth hormone). 2) Non-functioning: Do not produce excess hormones, but can cause symptoms by growing large and pressing on surrounding brain structures (mass effect) or by compressing normal pituitary tissue (leading to hypopituitarism - deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones). Symptoms depend on whether the adenoma is functioning (and which hormone is overproduced) and/or its size and location. Mass effect symptoms can include: headaches, vision problems (e.g., loss of peripheral vision - bitemporal hemianopsia, due to pressure on optic chiasm), double vision (if cranial nerves controlling eye movement are affected). Symptoms of hypopituitarism can include fatigue, weakness, weight changes, loss of libido, cold intolerance, etc. Most pituitary adenomas are sporadic, but some can be part of genetic syndromes.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent symptoms suggestive of a pituitary adenoma (e.g., unexplained headaches, vision changes, symptoms of hormone excess/deficiency, galactorrhea, menstrual irregularities, unexplained growth changes), consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist/neurosurgeon). Diagnosis involves blood and urine tests (to measure hormone levels), vision tests, and brain imaging (MRI with contrast is the preferred method to visualize the pituitary gland).",
    "self_care_tips": [

      "  - Medications:",
      "    - For prolactinomas: Dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline, bromocriptine) are usually very effective in shrinking the tumor and normalizing prolactin levels.",
      "    - For Cushing's disease or acromegaly: Medications may be used to reduce hormone production or block hormone effects (e.g., somatostatin analogs for acromegaly, drugs targeting adrenal cortisol production for Cushing's), often in conjunction with or if surgery is not curative.",
      "    - Hormone replacement therapy: If hypopituitarism is present due to tumor compression or treatment.",
      "  - Surgery (transsphenoidal surgery - through the nose/sphenoid sinus, or rarely craniotomy): Often the primary treatment for most symptomatic pituitary adenomas (except prolactinomas, where medication is usually first-line), especially if causing mass effect or significant hormone excess. The goal is to remove the tumor while preserving normal pituitary function.",

    "general_advice": "Pituitary disorder is a broad term for any condition affecting the pituitary gland, a small endocrine gland at the base of the brain that controls many other hormone glands and bodily functions. Disorders can arise from problems within the pituitary itself or from issues with the hypothalamus (which controls the pituitary). Pituitary disorders can lead to overproduction (hyperpituitarism) or underproduction (hypopituitarism) of one or more pituitary hormones. These hormones include: Growth Hormone (GH), Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH - controls cortisol), Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH - controls thyroid), Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH - control reproductive function/sex hormones), Prolactin (milk production), and Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH/Vasopressin - controls water balance, produced in hypothalamus but stored/released by posterior pituitary). Common pituitary disorders include: Pituitary adenomas (benign tumors - see separate entry, can be functioning or non-functioning), Hypopituitarism (deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, e.g., from tumor, surgery, radiation, trauma, infection, inflammation - hypophysitis), Hyperprolactinemia (excess prolactin), Acromegaly/Gigantism (excess GH), Cushing's disease (excess ACTH), Diabetes Insipidus (ADH deficiency or unresponsiveness - see separate entry), and Empty Sella Syndrome. Symptoms are highly variable depending on which hormone(s) are affected and whether there's over- or under-production, and if there's mass effect from a tumor (headaches, vision problems).",

    "general_advice": "Pityriasis rosea is a common, self-limiting skin rash that typically affects older children and young adults (ages 10-35), though it can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown, but it's thought to be triggered by a viral infection (possibly certain types of human herpesviruses like HHV-6 or HHV-7), though it's not considered contagious in the usual sense. The rash often begins with a single, larger oval or round, slightly raised, scaly patch called a 'herald patch' or 'mother patch,' usually on the trunk, neck, or upper arms/thighs. Within a few days to 2 weeks, numerous smaller, oval, pink or tan, scaly patches erupt, often in a characteristic 'Christmas tree' or 'fir tree' pattern on the back, chest, and abdomen (following skin cleavage lines). The rash can be mildly to moderately itchy in about 50% of cases. Sometimes, mild flu-like symptoms (fatigue, headache, sore throat, low-grade fever) may precede or accompany the rash. The rash typically lasts for 6-8 weeks (can range from 2 to 12 weeks or more) and then resolves on its own, usually without scarring, though some temporary skin discoloration (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) may occur, especially in darker skin tones.",

Heavy bleeding from placenta previa can be life-threatening for both mother and baby. Also seek care for signs of labor or contractions if you have a known previa, as uterine contractions can cause bleeding.",
    "general_advice": "Placenta previa is a pregnancy complication in which the placenta, the organ that nourishes the fetus, implants abnormally low in the uterus, partially or completely covering the cervix (the opening of the uterus). Normally, the placenta attaches to the upper part of the uterine wall. The main symptom of placenta previa is painless, bright red vaginal bleeding, typically occurring in the second or third trimester (often after 20 weeks), though it can happen earlier. The bleeding can range from light to very heavy and may start and stop spontaneously or be triggered by intercourse or vaginal exams. Some women may also experience uterine contractions or cramping. The exact cause is often unknown, but risk factors include: previous C-section or other uterine surgery (scarring can affect implantation site), previous placenta previa, being older maternal age (e.g., >35), multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets), smoking, cocaine use, and previous uterine procedures like D&C. Placenta previa can lead to serious complications, including severe maternal hemorrhage (bleeding), preterm birth, and need for emergency C-section. The placenta may also not detach properly after birth (placenta accreta spectrum if it invades uterine wall).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Placenta previa is often diagnosed during routine prenatal ultrasound exams (e.g., mid-pregnancy anatomy scan).

Rapid diagnosis and intervention are critical.",
    "general_advice": "Placental abruption (abruptio placentae) is a serious pregnancy complication where the placenta prematurely separates from the inner wall of the uterus, either partially or completely, before delivery of the baby. This separation can disrupt the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and can cause significant bleeding for the mother. It most commonly occurs in the third trimester but can happen any time after 20 weeks. The exact cause is often unknown, but risk factors include: previous placental abruption, high blood pressure (chronic hypertension or preeclampsia), abdominal trauma (e.g., from a fall or car accident), smoking, cocaine use, multiple pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes (PROM), uterine abnormalities or fibroids, older maternal age, and chorioamnionitis (infection of amniotic fluid/membranes). Symptoms vary depending on the degree of separation and amount of bleeding (see emergency advice). Concealed abruption (where blood is trapped behind placenta) can be particularly dangerous as external bleeding may be minimal despite significant internal blood loss and uterine pain/rigidity.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical care is essential if placental abruption is suspected. Diagnosis is often based on clinical symptoms and physical exam. Ultrasound may be used to look for a retroplacental hematoma (blood clot behind placenta) but is not always reliable for diagnosing abruption.

It's an inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick, web-like band of connective tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot, connecting the heel bone (calcaneus) to the base of the toes, supporting the arch of the foot. Plantar fasciitis occurs when this band becomes irritated and inflamed, often due to repetitive strain, overuse, or biomechanical issues. The hallmark symptom is stabbing or aching pain in the bottom of the heel, which is typically worst with the first few steps in the morning after waking up, or after periods of rest (post-static dyskinesia). The pain may improve with initial activity but can worsen again after prolonged standing, walking, or exercise. It can affect one or both feet. Risk factors include: activities that put a lot of stress on the heel (e.g., running, jumping, prolonged standing), flat feet (pes planus) or high arches (pes cavus), improper or unsupportive footwear, obesity, tight calf muscles (Achilles tendon), and age (common between 40-60). Heel spurs (bony growths on heel bone) are sometimes present with plantar fasciitis but are often not the primary cause of pain.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If heel pain is persistent, severe, or interfering with daily activities despite self-care, consult your doctor (primary care, podiatrist, or orthopedic foot specialist). Diagnosis is usually based on medical history and physical exam (tenderness at insertion of plantar fascia on heel). X-rays may be done to rule out other causes like stress fractures or heel spurs. Ultrasound or MRI are rarely needed unless diagnosis is unclear or other issues are suspected.",

A large or rapidly accumulating effusion can compress the lung and impair breathing significantly.",
    "general_advice": "A pleural effusion is an abnormal accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space, which is the thin space between the two layers of the pleura (the membranes that line the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest wall). Normally, this space contains only a very small amount of lubricating fluid. Pleural effusions are often a sign of an underlying medical condition. The fluid can be: 1) Transudative (watery fluid, low in protein): Caused by increased pressure in blood vessels or low blood protein levels, forcing fluid out. Common causes include congestive heart failure (most common), liver cirrhosis, kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome), or pulmonary embolism. 2) Exudative (protein-rich fluid, often with inflammatory cells): Caused by inflammation, infection, or malignancy affecting the pleura or nearby lung. Common causes include pneumonia, tuberculosis, cancer (lung cancer, metastatic cancer to pleura, lymphoma, mesothelioma), autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), pancreatitis, or viral infections. Symptoms depend on the size of the effusion and the underlying cause. Small effusions may be asymptomatic. Larger effusions can cause: shortness of breath (dyspnea, often worse when lying down), chest pain (often pleuritic - sharp, worse with deep breath or cough), dry cough, and sometimes fever or weight loss if due to infection or cancer.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain, or persistent cough, consult your doctor. Diagnosis involves a physical exam (may hear decreased breath sounds over effusion), chest X-ray (shows fluid), chest ultrasound, or CT scan. Thoracentesis (sampling of pleural fluid with a needle) is often performed to analyze the fluid (transudate vs. exudate, check for infection, cancer cells, etc.) and help determine the cause. A pleural biopsy may be needed if cause is still unclear.",

    "emergency_advice": "While pneumoconiosis is a chronic, progressive condition, seek immediate medical attention for acute respiratory distress or severe worsening of symptoms: sudden, severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; chest pain; coughing up blood; or signs of severe respiratory infection (high fever, worsening cough with increased sputum, confusion). Complications like progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), lung cancer, tuberculosis, or cor pulmonale (right heart failure) can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Pneumoconiosis is a general term for a group of chronic, restrictive lung diseases caused by the inhalation and deposition of certain types of mineral or organic dusts in the lungs, usually from occupational exposure over a long period (often many years). The dust particles cause inflammation and fibrosis (scarring) in the lung tissue, leading to impaired lung function. Common types include: 1) Coal worker's pneumoconiosis (CWP, 'black lung disease'): From inhalation of coal dust. 2) Silicosis: From inhalation of crystalline silica dust (e.g., in mining, quarrying, sandblasting, construction, foundries). Can be acute, accelerated, or chronic. Increases risk of tuberculosis. 3) Asbestosis: From inhalation of asbestos fibers (e.g., in insulation, shipbuilding, construction). Increases risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma (cancer of pleura). 4) Berylliosis: From inhalation of beryllium dust/fumes (e.g., aerospace, electronics). 5) Other less common types (e.g., siderosis - iron dust, talcosis - talc dust, byssinosis - cotton/flax/hemp dust). Symptoms often develop gradually after years of exposure and can include: progressive shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with exertion; chronic cough (may be dry or produce sputum, sometimes black in CWP); chest tightness; fatigue; and in advanced stages, signs of respiratory failure or cor pulmonale. Many pneumoconioses are irreversible and can progress even after exposure stops.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a history of significant occupational dust exposure and develop persistent respiratory symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care or pulmonologist, often one specializing in occupational lung diseases). Diagnosis involves a detailed occupational history, physical exam, lung function tests (spirometry, diffusing capacity - often show restrictive pattern and impaired gas exchange), and chest imaging (X-ray or high-resolution CT scan - HRCT can show characteristic patterns of fibrosis or nodules). Sometimes a lung biopsy may be needed, but often diagnosis is based on history and imaging.",

      "There is no cure for most pneumoconioses, and lung damage is usually permanent. Management aims to prevent further exposure, relieve symptoms, manage complications, and improve quality of life.",
      "  - Stop exposure to the offending dust immediately. This is the most important step to prevent further progression.",
      "  - Smoking cessation is crucial, as smoking can worsen lung damage and significantly increase risk of lung cancer, especially with asbestosis or silicosis.",
      "  - Symptomatic treatment: Bronchodilators (if airflow obstruction is also present), oxygen therapy (if blood oxygen levels are low), pulmonary rehabilitation (exercise, education, support).",
      "  - Get vaccinated: Annual flu shot, pneumococcal vaccine(s) to prevent respiratory infections, which can be very serious.",
      "  - Prompt treatment of any respiratory infections.",
      "  - Screening for complications: e.g., tuberculosis in silicosis, lung cancer in asbestosis/silicosis.",

    "general_advice": "Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia can be caused by various microorganisms, including: 1) Bacteria (most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in adults - e.g., *Streptococcus pneumoniae* / pneumococcus, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* - 'walking pneumonia', *Chlamydophila pneumoniae*, *Legionella pneumophila*). 2) Viruses (e.g., influenza virus - flu, respiratory syncytial virus - RSV, rhinoviruses - common cold viruses, SARS-CoV-2 - COVID-19). 3) Fungi (less common, usually in immunocompromised individuals or from specific environmental exposures - e.g., *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia - PJP/PCP in HIV/AIDS, *Aspergillus*, *Histoplasma*). 4) Aspiration pneumonia: Occurs if food, drink, vomit, or saliva is inhaled into the lungs, often in people with swallowing difficulties or altered consciousness. Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild ('walking pneumonia') to life-threatening. Severity depends on the causative organism, age, overall health, and immune status.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect pneumonia, consult your doctor. Symptoms often include cough (may be productive or dry), fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain (often pleuritic), fatigue, loss of appetite, and sometimes nausea/vomiting or confusion (especially in older adults).

Do not delay.",
    "general_advice": "A pneumothorax, commonly known as a collapsed lung, occurs when air leaks into the pleural space, the area between the lung and the chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of the lung, causing it to partially or completely collapse. A pneumothorax can be: 1) Spontaneous: Occurs without an obvious injury. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) happens in people without underlying lung disease (often tall, thin young men, possibly due to rupture of small air blisters - blebs/bullae). Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) occurs in people with underlying lung disease (e.g., COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease). 2) Traumatic: Caused by an injury to the chest, either blunt (e.g., from a fall, car accident, rib fracture) or penetrating (e.g., stab wound, gunshot wound, medical procedure like lung biopsy or central line placement). Tension pneumothorax is a particularly dangerous type where air enters the pleural space with each breath but cannot escape, leading to increasing pressure that compresses the lung, heart, and major blood vessels, causing severe respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if pneumothorax is suspected. Diagnosis involves a physical exam (may hear decreased or absent breath sounds on affected side) and a chest X-ray (shows air in pleural space and collapsed lung).

Ethylene glycol itself is not highly toxic, but it is metabolized in the liver by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to highly toxic byproducts (glycolaldehyde, glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and oxalic acid). These metabolites cause severe metabolic acidosis, and oxalic acid combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals, which deposit in tissues, particularly the kidneys (causing acute kidney injury/failure) and brain. Early symptoms can mimic alcohol intoxication, making diagnosis difficult if ingestion is not witnessed or suspected.",

    "general_advice": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited (genetic) disorder characterized by the growth of numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. These cysts can enlarge the kidneys over time, replacing normal kidney tissue and impairing kidney function, eventually leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure in many cases. There are two main types: 1) Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD): Most common inherited kidney disease, usually caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 genes. Symptoms typically develop in adulthood (often between ages 30-50), though cysts may be present from a younger age. 2) Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD): Rarer and often more severe, usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood. Caused by mutations in PKHD1 gene. In addition to kidney cysts, PKD can also cause cysts in other organs (e.g., liver, pancreas, spleen), high blood pressure (hypertension - very common and develops early in ADPKD), kidney stones, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) or cyst infections, hematuria (blood in urine), flank or back pain, abdominal fullness, and an increased risk of intracranial (berry) aneurysms (in ADPKD).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a family history of PKD or experience symptoms like flank pain, hematuria, recurrent UTIs, or high blood pressure, consult your doctor (primary care or nephrologist).

Key features (Rotterdam criteria - need 2 out of 3 for diagnosis): 1) Irregular menstrual periods or absent periods (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), due to infrequent or absent ovulation (anovulation). 2) Hyperandrogenism: Clinical signs (hirsutism - excess male-pattern hair growth, severe acne, androgenic alopecia - male-pattern hair loss) OR biochemical evidence (high androgen levels in blood). 3) Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound: Ovaries may be enlarged and contain numerous small follicles (often described as a 'string of pearls' appearance), though this finding alone is not sufficient for diagnosis and not all women with PCOS have it. PCOS is also associated with insulin resistance (where body cells don't respond well to insulin, leading to higher insulin levels and often contributing to androgen excess and metabolic problems), obesity or weight gain (especially abdominal), increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep apnea, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer (due to chronic anovulation and unopposed estrogen), infertility, and mood disorders (depression, anxiety).",

    "general_advice": "Polycythemia vera (PV) is a rare, chronic type of myeloproliferative neoplasm (a group of blood cancers) characterized by the overproduction of red blood cells (erythrocytosis) by the bone marrow. It often also involves overproduction of white blood cells (leukocytosis) and platelets (thrombocytosis). This increase in blood cells, especially red cells, makes the blood thicker (hyperviscosity), which can slow blood flow and increase the risk of blood clots (thrombosis) in arteries or veins, leading to complications like heart attack, stroke, DVT, or PE. It can also cause bleeding problems if platelets are dysfunctional. Most cases of PV are caused by a mutation in the JAK2 gene (specifically JAK2 V617F mutation) in blood-forming stem cells. PV usually develops slowly and is more common in older adults (often over 60), though can occur at any age. Symptoms can be vague initially or absent. When present, they may include: headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath (especially when lying down), itching (pruritus, often worse after a warm bath or shower - aquagenic pruritus), ruddy or reddish complexion (plethora), blurred vision or seeing spots, ringing in ears (tinnitus), night sweats, weight loss, feeling of fullness in upper abdomen (due to enlarged spleen - splenomegaly), and sometimes gout (due to increased uric acid from cell turnover) or peptic ulcers.

Call a crisis hotline, go to an ER, or call emergency services.",
    "general_advice": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying, traumatic event. Traumatic events can include combat exposure, physical or sexual assault, childhood abuse, natural disasters, accidents, terrorist attacks, or other life-threatening events. Not everyone who experiences trauma develops PTSD. Symptoms of PTSD typically begin within 3 months of the trauma but can sometimes emerge years later. They are grouped into four main categories: 1) Intrusion symptoms: Recurrent, unwanted, distressing memories of the event; flashbacks (feeling as if the event is happening again); nightmares; intense emotional or physical reactions to reminders (triggers) of the event. 2) Avoidance: Avoiding thoughts, feelings, people, places, activities, or conversations that are reminders of the trauma. 3) Negative alterations in cognitions and mood: Persistent negative thoughts/beliefs about oneself, others, or the world; distorted blame of self or others for the trauma; persistent negative emotions (fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame); diminished interest in activities; feeling detached or estranged from others; inability to experience positive emotions. 4) Alterations in arousal and reactivity: Irritable behavior and angry outbursts; reckless or self-destructive behavior; hypervigilance (being constantly on guard); exaggerated startle response; problems with concentration; sleep disturbances. Symptoms must last for more than one month and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning.",

Also, if an incision suddenly opens up (dehiscence) with signs of infection.",
    "general_advice": "A postoperative infection, also known as a surgical site infection (SSI), is an infection that occurs in the part of the body where surgery was performed. SSIs can develop within 30 days after surgery (or up to a year if an implant like a joint replacement or mesh was placed). They are caused by bacteria entering the surgical wound, either during surgery (from skin flora, surgical team, environment, or contaminated instruments) or after surgery (e.g., from poor wound care, or bacteria spreading from another site). SSIs are classified by depth: 1) Superficial incisional SSI: Involves only the skin and subcutaneous tissue at the incision line. 2) Deep incisional SSI: Involves deeper soft tissues, such as fascia and muscle layers, beneath the incision. 3) Organ/space SSI: Involves any part of the anatomy (e.g., organ or body cavity) other than the incised body wall layers that was opened or manipulated during surgery. Symptoms of an SSI include: increasing pain, redness, swelling, and warmth at or around the surgical incision; pus or cloudy, foul-smelling drainage from the incision; fever; and sometimes delayed wound healing or the incision opening up. Risk factors include patient-related factors (e.g., diabetes, obesity, smoking, malnutrition, weakened immune system, pre-existing infection elsewhere) and surgery-related factors (e.g., type and duration of surgery, emergency surgery, surgical technique, wound contamination).",

    "general_advice": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder that can affect women after childbirth. It's more intense and longer-lasting than the 'baby blues' (mild mood swings, sadness, anxiety that usually resolve within 2 weeks postpartum). PPD can begin anytime within the first year after delivery, though often starts within the first few weeks or months. Symptoms are similar to major depressive disorder and can include: persistent sad, anxious, or 'empty' mood; severe mood swings; excessive crying; loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed (including with the baby); difficulty bonding with the baby; feelings of guilt, worthlessness, inadequacy, or shame; significant fatigue or loss of energy; changes in appetite or sleep patterns (insomnia or oversleeping, even when baby sleeps); difficulty concentrating or making decisions; restlessness or irritability; social withdrawal; and sometimes thoughts of death, suicide, or harming oneself or the baby. The exact cause is unknown but likely involves a combination of hormonal changes (rapid drop in estrogen/progesterone after delivery), physical changes of childbirth and recovery, sleep deprivation, stress, psychological factors (e.g., history of depression/anxiety, difficult pregnancy/delivery, lack of social support, relationship stress, unrealistic expectations).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are experiencing symptoms of PPD, it's crucial to reach out to your doctor (obstetrician, primary care physician) or a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist) as soon as possible.

Any of these 'severe features' warrant immediate evaluation. If seizures occur (eclampsia), call emergency services immediately.",
    "general_advice": "Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by new-onset high blood pressure (hypertension, typically ≥140/90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart, or a single severe reading ≥160/110 mmHg) occurring after 20 weeks of gestation in a woman who previously had normal blood pressure, AND proteinuria (protein in urine) OR, in the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with other signs of maternal organ dysfunction or uteroplacental dysfunction. These other signs can include: low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), impaired liver function (elevated liver enzymes, severe right upper quadrant pain), kidney problems (newly elevated creatinine), pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs), or new-onset neurological symptoms (headache, vision changes) or fetal growth restriction (IUGR). The exact cause is not fully understood but is thought to involve abnormal placental development and function, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. Risk factors include: first pregnancy, history of preeclampsia in previous pregnancy, multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets), chronic hypertension, pre-existing diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome), obesity, older maternal age (>35-40), and family history of preeclampsia.",

This is to rule out underlying heart conditions or more significant arrhythmias.",
    "general_advice": "Premature atrial contractions (PACs), also called atrial premature beats (APBs) or atrial extrasystoles, are common, usually harmless, extra heartbeats that originate in the atria (upper chambers of the heart) earlier than the next expected normal heartbeat. They occur when an ectopic focus (an area outside the sinoatrial node - the heart's natural pacemaker) in the atria fires prematurely, causing the atria to contract too soon. This early beat is then usually conducted to the ventricles, resulting in an early heartbeat that can be felt as a skipped beat, a flutter, a thump, or a pause followed by a stronger beat. PACs are very common in people of all ages, including those with healthy hearts, and often cause no symptoms or are only mildly perceived. They can be triggered or exacerbated by factors like stress, anxiety, fatigue, caffeine, alcohol, smoking, certain medications (e.g., decongestants, asthma inhalers), electrolyte imbalances, or underlying heart or lung disease. Frequent PACs can sometimes be a precursor to more sustained arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, especially in individuals with underlying heart conditions.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience frequent or bothersome palpitations, or if PACs are new or associated with other symptoms, consult your doctor. An EKG (electrocardiogram) can detect PACs. If they are infrequent, a Holter monitor (24-48 hour EKG) or event recorder may be needed to capture them.

Also, if there are concerns about bone health (e.g., fracture from osteoporosis).",
    "general_advice": "Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), formerly known as premature ovarian failure (POF), is a condition in which a woman's ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40. This means the ovaries no longer produce normal amounts of estrogen and do not regularly release eggs (ovulate). POI is different from premature menopause; in POI, some women may still have intermittent ovarian function and occasional periods, and a small chance of spontaneous pregnancy, whereas menopause is the permanent cessation of ovarian function. The hallmark of POI is amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods for at least 4-6 months) or oligomenorrhea (infrequent periods) before age 40, along with elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (in the menopausal range) and low estrogen levels on at least two occasions. Causes of POI can include: genetic factors (e.g., Turner syndrome, Fragile X premutation), autoimmune disorders (immune system attacks ovaries), chemotherapy or radiation therapy (iatrogenic), surgical removal of ovaries, or idiopathic (unknown cause - most common). Symptoms are often similar to those of menopause: irregular or absent periods, hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, decreased libido, sleep disturbances, mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression), difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. POI also leads to infertility and increased risk of long-term health problems like osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease due to estrogen deficiency.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are under 40 and experience irregular or absent periods for several months, or other symptoms of estrogen deficiency, consult your doctor or gynecologist/reproductive endocrinologist. Diagnosis involves a medical history, pelvic exam, and blood tests for hormone levels (FSH, estradiol, AMH - anti-Müllerian hormone). Karyotype (chromosome analysis) and FMR1 gene testing (for Fragile X premutation) may also be done.",

    "general_advice": "Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) refers to the breaking of the amniotic sac ('water breaking') before the onset of labor. If this occurs at or after 37 weeks of gestation, it's called term PROM. If it occurs before 37 weeks, it's called preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), which carries higher risks for both mother and baby. The main symptom is a gush or a steady trickle of clear or pale yellow fluid from the vagina. The cause of PROM/PPROM is often unknown, but risk factors can include: infection of the genital tract (e.g., bacterial vaginosis, UTI, chorioamnionitis), previous PPROM, short cervical length, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid), smoking, poor nutrition, or trauma. Complications depend on gestational age at rupture and duration of rupture. For mother: increased risk of infection (chorioamnionitis, endometritis), placental abruption. For baby (especially with PPROM): prematurity and its associated complications (respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis), infection (sepsis, pneumonia), umbilical cord compression (can lead to fetal distress), and pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs if rupture is very early and prolonged).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate obstetric evaluation is essential if you suspect your membranes have ruptured.

Any suicidal ideation requires immediate help.",
    "general_advice": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), often referred to as premenstrual tension (PMT), is a common condition characterized by a combination of physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that occur in a cyclical pattern during the luteal phase (second half) of the menstrual cycle, typically starting 1-2 weeks before menstruation and resolving within a few days after the period begins. The exact cause is not fully understood but is thought to be related to cyclical changes in hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) and their interaction with brain chemicals (neurotransmitters like serotonin). Symptoms vary widely among women and can range from mild to severe. Common symptoms include: Emotional/Behavioral: Mood swings, irritability, anxiety, tension, feeling overwhelmed, sadness or crying spells, difficulty concentrating, changes in sleep patterns (insomnia or oversleeping), changes in appetite or food cravings, social withdrawal, decreased interest in activities. Physical: Breast tenderness or swelling, abdominal bloating, headache, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, weight gain (fluid retention), acne flare-ups, constipation or diarrhea. For symptoms to be diagnosed as PMS, they must be severe enough to interfere with daily activities and must occur consistently in the luteal phase with a symptom-free period after menstruation. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a more severe form of PMS with prominent mood symptoms causing significant distress or impairment.",

    "emergency_advice": "While presbycusis is a gradual process, seek prompt medical attention if you experience sudden, significant hearing loss in one or both ears, as this could indicate a different, potentially treatable acute condition (e.g., sudden sensorineural hearing loss - SSHL, which needs urgent evaluation and treatment; or impacted earwax, infection, Meniere's disease, stroke).",
    "general_advice": "Presbycusis is the gradual loss of hearing that occurs in most individuals as they age. It's a common type of sensorineural hearing loss, meaning it results from damage to the inner ear (cochlea) and/or the auditory nerve pathways leading to the brain. The hearing loss is usually bilateral (affecting both ears, often symmetrically) and typically affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds more than low-frequency sounds initially. This can make it difficult to understand speech, especially in noisy environments or when consonants (which are often high-frequency) are missed, making words sound muffled or unclear. People with presbycusis may also experience tinnitus (ringing in ears) or have difficulty tolerating loud sounds (hyperacusis). The exact causes are complex and multifactorial, including: cumulative effects of aging on inner ear structures, genetic predisposition, long-term exposure to loud noise (noise-induced hearing loss can accelerate presbycusis), certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and some medications (ototoxic drugs).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a gradual decline in your hearing or have difficulty understanding speech, consult your doctor, an audiologist (hearing specialist), or an ENT specialist. A comprehensive hearing test (audiogram) can diagnose presbycusis, determine its severity, and rule out other causes of hearing loss. Early detection and management can significantly improve communication and quality of life.",

    "general_advice": "Presbyopia is a common, age-related vision condition that makes it progressively more difficult to focus on close-up objects. It typically becomes noticeable around age 40-45 and continues to worsen until around age 60-65. Presbyopia occurs because the natural lens inside the eye gradually loses its elasticity and flexibility with age, and the ciliary muscle (which controls lens shape for focusing) may also weaken. This reduces the eye's ability to accommodate, i.e., to change focus from distant to near objects. Symptoms include: difficulty reading small print or seeing fine details up close (needing to hold reading material further away), eye strain, headaches, or fatigue when doing close work (reading, sewing, computer use). Presbyopia affects everyone as they age, regardless of whether they have other refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), or astigmatism. It can occur in addition to these other conditions.",

If not treated promptly (ideally within 4-6 hours), priapism can lead to permanent damage to the erectile tissue of the penis, scarring, and erectile dysfunction.",
    "general_advice": "Priapism is a prolonged erection of the penis that is not caused by sexual stimulation and does not resolve after orgasm or with cessation of stimulation. It can be painful. There are two main types: 1) Ischemic priapism (low-flow or veno-occlusive - most common and an emergency): Blood gets trapped in the erectile chambers (corpora cavernosa) and cannot drain out properly. The penis is usually rigid and painful. This type can lead to tissue damage due to lack of oxygen. 2) Non-ischemic priapism (high-flow or arterial - less common, usually not as painful, less urgent): Caused by unregulated arterial blood flow into the penis, often due to trauma to the penis or perineum that damages an artery. The penis is often less rigid than in ischemic priapism. Causes of ischemic priapism can include: Sickle cell disease (common cause, especially in children/young men), Blood disorders (e.g., leukemia, thalassemia), Certain medications (e.g., some antidepressants like trazodone, antipsychotics, alpha-blockers, drugs for erectile dysfunction - especially intracavernosal injections like alprostadil, or oral PDE5 inhibitors if misused/overdosed), Illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine, marijuana), Spinal cord injury, or Idiopathic (unknown cause).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if an erection lasts longer than 4 hours without sexual stimulation or if it's painful and persistent. Diagnosis involves a medical history (including medication/drug use), physical exam, and sometimes blood gas analysis from a sample of blood drawn from the penis (to differentiate ischemic vs. non-ischemic - ischemic blood is dark, acidic, low oxygen; non-ischemic is bright red, oxygenated). Doppler ultrasound may also be used.",

    "general_advice": "Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDDs), also increasingly called Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEIs), are a large and diverse group of over 450 rare, chronic disorders in which part of the body's immune system is missing or functions improperly. These disorders are genetic, meaning they are caused by defects in genes involved in immune system development or function. Because the immune system is weakened, individuals with PIDDs are more susceptible to recurrent and often severe infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic), which may be difficult to treat or involve unusual organisms. They may also have an increased risk of certain cancers (e.g., lymphoma), autoimmune diseases (where immune system attacks body's own tissues), and chronic inflammation. PIDDs can affect various components of the immune system, including B-cells (antibody production), T-cells (cellular immunity), phagocytes (cells that engulf pathogens), complement system, or innate immunity. Symptoms vary greatly depending on the specific PIDD and the parts of the immune system affected, but common warning signs include: frequent and recurrent infections (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, ear infections, skin infections, meningitis), infections that are unusually severe or resistant to treatment, infections with opportunistic or unusual organisms, failure to thrive or poor growth in infants/children, chronic diarrhea, autoimmune disease, unexplained fevers, or a family history of PIDD. Some PIDDs are diagnosed in infancy through newborn screening or due to severe early infections, while others may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood if symptoms are milder or atypical.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child experiences recurrent, severe, or unusual infections, or other warning signs suggestive of a PIDD, consult your doctor (pediatrician, primary care, or immunologist specializing in PIDDs). Diagnosis involves a detailed medical and family history, physical exam, blood tests (e.g., complete blood count with differential, quantitative immunoglobulins - IgG, IgA, IgM; antibody responses to vaccines; lymphocyte subset analysis - T, B, NK cells; complement tests), and often genetic testing to identify the specific gene defect.",

    "general_advice": "Primary insomnia was a term used for insomnia that was not directly attributable to another medical condition, mental disorder, or substance use. In current diagnostic systems (like DSM-5), it's often encompassed within 'Insomnia Disorder,' which is characterized by persistent difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep (frequent awakenings, difficulty returning to sleep), or early morning awakening with inability to return to sleep, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. This results in daytime impairment, such as fatigue, low energy, difficulty concentrating, mood disturbances (irritability, anxiety, depression), and reduced performance at work or school. Insomnia Disorder can be episodic, recurrent, or persistent (chronic if ≥3 months, ≥3 nights/week). While identifiable causes (secondary insomnia) are common (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression, pain, medical conditions, medications, poor sleep habits, shift work, environmental factors), sometimes a clear cause isn't apparent, or the insomnia persists even after a trigger is resolved, becoming a conditioned or learned problem (psychophysiological insomnia - where worry about sleep itself perpetuates the insomnia).",

Platelets are blood cells essential for blood clotting. In ET, the excess platelets are often abnormal and can lead to an increased risk of blood clots (thrombosis) in arteries or veins, or less commonly, bleeding problems (hemorrhage) if platelets are dysfunctional or extremely elevated. Many people with ET are asymptomatic at diagnosis, with the condition found incidentally on a routine blood test showing a high platelet count.

Seek immediate medical attention for: significant vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal/pelvic pain, leakage of amniotic fluid (water breaking, especially if preterm), signs of preeclampsia (severe headache, vision changes, upper abdominal pain, significant swelling), decreased/absent fetal movement, fever/chills with other concerning symptoms, persistent vomiting preventing fluid/food intake, or any other sudden, severe, or concerning symptoms during pregnancy. (This is similar to 'Pregnancy' emergency advice).",
    "general_advice": "Problem during pregnancy, or pregnancy complication, refers to any health issue that arises during pregnancy affecting the mother, the fetus, or both. While many pregnancies proceed without major issues, complications can occur and range from mild to severe and life-threatening. Examples include: Miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks), Ectopic pregnancy (fertilized egg implants outside uterus), Gestational diabetes, Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia), Placenta previa, Placental abruption, Preterm labor and birth, Premature rupture of membranes (PROM/PPROM), Infections during pregnancy (e.g., UTIs, Group B Strep, TORCH infections), Anemia, Hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea/vomiting), Blood clots (DVT/PE - risk is increased in pregnancy), Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR - baby not growing properly), Oligohydramnios/Polyhydramnios (too little/too much amniotic fluid), Rh incompatibility, and complications related to pre-existing medical conditions in the mother (e.g., heart disease, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, thyroid disorders).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Regular prenatal care with an obstetrician, midwife, or family doctor is crucial for monitoring for, preventing, and managing pregnancy complications. It's essential to attend all scheduled appointments and to report any new, unusual, or concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately, even if they seem minor.

    "general_advice": "Prostate cancer is cancer that develops in the prostate gland, a small, walnut-shaped gland in men located below the bladder and in front of the rectum, which produces seminal fluid. Most prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas and tend to grow slowly, often remaining confined to the prostate for many years without causing symptoms. However, some types can be aggressive and spread quickly. Early prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms may include: difficulty urinating (hesitancy, weak or interrupted stream, frequent urination - especially at night, dribbling), blood in urine (hematuria) or semen (hematospermia), pain or burning during urination (less common), erectile dysfunction, pain in the hips, back (spine), chest (ribs), or pelvis (if cancer has spread to bones), and unexplained weight loss or fatigue (in advanced disease). Risk factors include: older age (most common in men over 65), African-American race (higher incidence and mortality), family history of prostate cancer, certain genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, Lynch syndrome), and possibly diet (high in red meat/dairy, low in fruits/vegetables - though links are not definitive).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Discuss prostate cancer screening with your doctor (primary care or urologist), based on your age, risk factors, and personal preferences. Screening typically involves a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and a digital rectal exam (DRE). If screening tests are abnormal or if you have symptoms, further investigation (e.g., transrectal ultrasound - TRUS, MRI of prostate, prostate biopsy - to confirm diagnosis and determine Gleason score/grade) is needed. Staging (with imaging like bone scan, CT, MRI, PET scan) determines extent of spread.",
    "self_care_tips": [

Also, if chronic prostatitis symptoms are unbearable or significantly impacting quality of life.",
    "general_advice": "Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland, a small gland located below the bladder in men that produces seminal fluid. There are several types: 1) Acute bacterial prostatitis: A sudden bacterial infection of the prostate, causing acute symptoms like fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, pain in the pelvic area/groin/lower back/genitals, painful or frequent urination, urgency, burning during urination, cloudy or bloody urine, and sometimes painful ejaculation or difficulty urinating. Requires prompt antibiotic treatment. 2) Chronic bacterial prostatitis: A recurrent or persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, often with milder, intermittent symptoms similar to acute, or sometimes just recurrent UTIs. Can be difficult to eradicate. 3) Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS - most common type): Characterized by chronic pelvic pain (in prostate, perineum, genitals, lower back, abdomen) lasting at least 3 months, often with urinary symptoms and sometimes sexual dysfunction, but with no evidence of bacterial infection. Cause is often unknown but may involve previous infection, inflammation, nerve problems, stress, or pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. Subdivided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory CP/CPPS based on presence of white blood cells in prostatic secretions/urine. 4) Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis: Inflammation of prostate found incidentally (e.g., during biopsy for other reasons) but causes no symptoms.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of prostatitis, consult your doctor (primary care or urologist). Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam (including digital rectal exam - DRE, to feel prostate), urine tests (urinalysis, urine culture, sometimes pre- and post-prostatic massage urine/secretion analysis - e.g., Meares-Stamey 4-glass test), and sometimes blood tests or imaging (ultrasound) to rule out other conditions or complications (like prostatic abscess).",
    "self_care_tips": [

Severe PEM, especially in children (kwashiorkor, marasmus), is life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Protein deficiency occurs when the body does not get enough protein from the diet, or when it cannot properly absorb or utilize protein, leading to a shortage of amino acids needed for building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function. Hypoproteinemia specifically refers to low protein levels in the blood, particularly albumin (hypoalbuminemia). Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) is a broader term for deficiency of both protein and calories. Causes of protein deficiency include: 1) Inadequate dietary intake: Insufficient protein consumption (e.g., due to poverty, famine, restrictive diets, eating disorders, elderly with poor appetite/dentition). 2) Malabsorption syndromes: Conditions that impair digestion or absorption of protein (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome). 3) Increased protein loss: From kidneys (nephrotic syndrome), gut (protein-losing enteropathy), extensive burns, or severe wounds. 4) Increased protein requirements: During periods of rapid growth (infancy, adolescence), pregnancy, lactation, critical illness, major surgery, or trauma. 5) Chronic diseases: e.g., advanced liver disease (impaired protein synthesis), kidney disease (protein loss), cancer (cachexia). Symptoms can include: edema (swelling, often in legs, feet, abdomen, face - due to low albumin), muscle wasting and weakness, fatigue, lethargy, slow wound healing, hair loss or changes in hair texture/color, brittle nails, dry/flaky skin, increased susceptibility to infections (impaired immune function), stunted growth in children, and mood changes (apathy, irritability).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect protein deficiency based on symptoms or risk factors, consult your doctor. Diagnosis involves a medical history (including dietary assessment), physical exam (looking for signs like edema, muscle wasting), and blood tests (e.g., serum albumin, total protein, prealbumin, CBC for anemia). Further tests may be needed to identify an underlying cause.",

Symptoms include tetany (muscle spasms/cramps), seizures, laryngospasm, or cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "general_advice": "Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a group of rare inherited (genetic) disorders characterized by end-organ resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH). This means that although the parathyroid glands produce normal or even high levels of PTH, the body's tissues (primarily kidneys and bones) do not respond to it properly. PTH normally acts to increase blood calcium levels and decrease blood phosphorus levels. Due to PTH resistance, individuals with PHP typically have: hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), hyperphosphatemia (high blood phosphorus), and elevated PTH levels. Symptoms are often related to hypocalcemia (see Hypocalcemia entry - e.g., numbness/tingling, muscle cramps/spasms, seizures). There are different subtypes of PHP (e.g., PHP type 1a, 1b, 1c, 2). PHP type 1a is often associated with a constellation of physical features known as Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), which can include short stature, round face, obesity, short fourth and/or fifth fingers/toes (brachydactyly), and subcutaneous calcifications or ossifications. Individuals with AHO may or may not have PTH resistance (if they have AHO features but normal calcium/PTH, it's called pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism - PPHP). Other hormonal resistances (e.g., to TSH, LH/FSH) can also occur in some PHP subtypes. PHP is caused by mutations in genes involved in the PTH signaling pathway, most commonly the GNAS gene.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a child or adult presents with symptoms of hypocalcemia, characteristic AHO features, or if there's a family history, consult a doctor (pediatrician, endocrinologist, or geneticist). Diagnosis involves blood tests (calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D, kidney function), urine tests (for calcium/phosphate excretion), genetic testing for GNAS or other relevant gene mutations, and assessment for AHO features or other hormone resistances.",

      "Management is lifelong and aims to maintain normal blood calcium and phosphorus levels, prevent symptoms of hypocalcemia, and manage associated conditions. It's guided by an endocrinologist.",
      "  - Calcium supplements: Oral calcium is given to raise blood calcium.",
      "  - Vitamin D supplements: Active forms of vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol, alfacalcidol) are usually needed, as PTH resistance also impairs the kidney's ability to activate vitamin D, which is crucial for calcium absorption.",
      "  - Phosphate binders: May be used if hyperphosphatemia is significant.",
      "  - Thiazide diuretics: Can sometimes help reduce urinary calcium excretion and increase blood calcium.",
      "Regular monitoring of blood calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D, and urine calcium levels is essential to adjust treatment and avoid both hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia (from over-treatment).",

Progressive vision loss due to papilledema (optic disc swelling) is a serious complication that can lead to permanent blindness if not treated promptly.",
    "general_advice": "Pseudotumor cerebri, now more commonly known as Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP - pressure inside the skull) in the absence of a brain tumor, hydrocephalus, infection, or other identifiable structural cause. 'Idiopathic' means the cause is unknown. It primarily affects obese women of childbearing age, but can occur in men and children. The increased ICP can cause symptoms similar to those of a brain tumor (hence 'pseudotumor'). Symptoms include: severe, often daily, headaches (can be throbbing, worse with eye movement, or in morning); pulsatile tinnitus (whooshing or ringing sound in ears, often in time with pulse); transient visual obscurations (brief episodes of blurred or dimmed vision, like a curtain coming down, especially with changes in posture); blurred vision; double vision (diplopia, due to cranial nerve VI palsy); neck, shoulder, or back pain; and sometimes nausea or dizziness. A key concern is papilledema (swelling of the optic disc at the back of the eye due to increased ICP), which can lead to progressive peripheral vision loss and eventual blindness if pressure is not controlled.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent, severe headaches, vision changes, or pulsatile tinnitus, consult your doctor (primary care, neurologist, or ophthalmologist/neuro-ophthalmologist). Diagnosis involves a neurological exam, ophthalmological exam (to check for papilledema and assess vision), brain imaging (MRI or CT scan, usually with venography - MRV/CTV, to rule out tumor, hydrocephalus, venous sinus thrombosis, etc. - brain imaging is typically normal in IIH other than signs of high ICP like empty sella or optic nerve sheath distension), and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to measure CSF opening pressure (which is elevated in IIH) and analyze CSF (which is normal in IIH).",

Also, if joint pain is very severe and acute (could be psoriatic arthritis flare or septic arthritis), or if there are severe side effects from systemic medications.",
    "general_advice": "Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disease characterized by an accelerated life cycle of skin cells, leading to a rapid buildup of cells on the skin's surface. This forms thick, scaly, itchy, and often painful patches or plaques. The inflammation is driven by an overactive immune system. Psoriasis can vary in severity from a few small patches to widespread involvement. Common types include: 1) Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris - most common): Raised, red patches covered with silvery-white scales. Often on elbows, knees, scalp, lower back. 2) Guttate psoriasis: Small, dot-like, scaly lesions, often triggered by a strep infection. 3) Inverse psoriasis: Smooth, red, inflamed patches in skin folds (armpits, groin, under breasts). 4) Pustular psoriasis: Pus-filled blisters (non-infectious pus). 5) Erythrodermic psoriasis: Widespread redness and shedding of skin. Psoriasis can also affect nails (pitting, discoloration, thickening, separation from nail bed) and joints (psoriatic arthritis - PsA, causing pain, stiffness, swelling in joints, can be similar to rheumatoid arthritis). The exact cause is unknown but involves genetic predisposition and immune system dysregulation. Triggers for flare-ups can include stress, skin injury (Koebner phenomenon), infections (strep throat for guttate), certain medications (e.g., lithium, beta-blockers, antimalarials), cold/dry weather, smoking, and heavy alcohol consumption.",

    "general_advice": "Psychotic disorder is a general term for a group of serious mental illnesses that affect the mind, causing a person to lose touch with reality (psychosis). Psychosis is characterized by disturbances in thoughts, perceptions, emotions, and behavior. Key symptoms include: 1) Delusions: Fixed, false beliefs that are not based in reality and are resistant to reason (e.g., paranoid delusions - believing one is being persecuted; grandiose delusions - believing one has special powers; somatic delusions - false beliefs about one's body). 2) Hallucinations: Sensory experiences that occur in the absence of an external stimulus (e.g., auditory - hearing voices, most common; visual - seeing things; tactile, olfactory, gustatory). 3) Disorganized thinking and speech: Difficulty organizing thoughts, incoherent or illogical speech (e.g., loose associations, word salad). 4) Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior: Agitation, catatonia (unresponsiveness or bizarre postures), unpredictable behavior. 5) Negative symptoms (more common in schizophrenia): Reduced emotional expression (flat affect), lack of motivation (avolition), social withdrawal, poverty of speech (alogia), diminished ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia). Examples of psychotic disorders include: Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective disorder, Schizophreniform disorder, Brief psychotic disorder, Delusional disorder, Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, and Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe mood disorders (e.g., bipolar mania with psychosis, severe depression with psychotic features).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of psychosis, it is crucial to seek professional help from a doctor or mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist) as soon as possible. Early intervention can significantly improve outcomes.

    "emergency_advice": "While a pterygium itself is not usually an emergency, seek medical attention if it becomes very inflamed, painful, significantly red, or if there's a rapid change in vision or a feeling that it's growing quickly over the cornea towards the pupil. This is to rule out other conditions or complications.",
    "general_advice": "A pterygium (plural: pterygia), sometimes called 'surfer's eye,' is a benign (non-cancerous), fleshy, wing-shaped growth of conjunctival tissue that extends from the conjunctiva (clear membrane over white of eye) onto the cornea (clear front surface of the eye). It typically starts on the nasal side (inner corner) of the eye and grows towards the pupil. Pterygia are thought to be caused by chronic exposure to environmental irritants, primarily ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, but also wind, dust, sand, and dry conditions. They are more common in people who live in sunny, windy, or dusty climates and spend a lot of time outdoors. Small pterygia may cause no symptoms or only mild irritation. Larger or inflamed pterygia can cause: redness, itching, burning, gritty or foreign body sensation, blurred vision (if it grows onto cornea and distorts its shape, causing astigmatism, or if it covers pupil), and cosmetic concerns. It's different from a pinguecula, which is a yellowish bump on the conjunctiva that does NOT grow onto the cornea.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a growth on your eye that you suspect might be a pterygium, or if a known pterygium becomes symptomatic or seems to be growing, consult an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist). They can diagnose it by examining your eye and recommend management.",

      "Surgical removal of a pterygium is considered if: it's causing persistent discomfort, significantly affecting vision (e.g., by inducing astigmatism or growing over pupil), growing rapidly, or for cosmetic reasons. Surgery involves excising the pterygium, often with a conjunctival autograft (transplanting a piece of healthy conjunctiva to the bare area to reduce recurrence) or amniotic membrane transplant. Recurrence is possible after surgery, especially in younger individuals or with continued UV exposure."

This can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Pulmonary congestion, often referred to as pulmonary edema, is an abnormal buildup of excess fluid in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. This fluid interferes with normal oxygen exchange, making it difficult to breathe. It's usually a symptom of an underlying medical condition. The most common cause is congestive heart failure (CHF - see Heart Failure entry), particularly left-sided heart failure. When the left ventricle cannot pump blood effectively out to the body, blood backs up into the pulmonary veins and capillaries, increasing pressure and forcing fluid into the alveoli (cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Other less common causes (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema) can include: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS - see separate entry), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), drug overdose (e.g., opioids, aspirin), toxins/smoke inhalation, kidney failure (fluid overload), severe infections (pneumonia, sepsis), neurological problems (neurogenic pulmonary edema, e.g., after head injury or seizure), or near-drowning. Symptoms depend on severity and onset (can be acute or chronic) but typically include: shortness of breath (dyspnea - often worse with exertion or when lying flat/orthopnea, may wake from sleep - paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), cough (may be dry or produce frothy, sometimes pink-tinged sputum), wheezing or crackling sounds in lungs (rales), feeling of anxiety or suffocation, and sometimes chest pain or palpitations if heart-related.",

A large PE can cause sudden collapse and cardiac arrest.",
    "general_advice": "A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot (thrombus), usually originating from a deep vein in the leg or pelvis (deep vein thrombosis - DVT, see separate entry), breaks loose (becoming an embolus), travels through the bloodstream, and lodges in an artery in the lungs, blocking blood flow to a part of the lung. This can be very dangerous as it strains the right side of the heart and reduces oxygen levels in the blood. Multiple clots can be involved. Risk factors for PE are similar to those for DVT and include: prolonged immobility (long travel, bed rest after surgery/illness), major surgery (especially orthopedic, abdominal, pelvic), trauma or injury (especially to legs), cancer and its treatments, inherited blood clotting disorders (thrombophilia), hormone therapy or hormonal contraceptives (especially those with estrogen), pregnancy and postpartum period, obesity, smoking, older age, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous DVT or PE. Symptoms can vary greatly depending on the size of the clot and the extent of lung involvement (see emergency advice). Some PEs can be small and cause minimal symptoms, while others are massive and immediately life-threatening.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical care is essential if PE is suspected. Diagnosis involves assessing risk factors and symptoms, blood tests (D-dimer - can help rule out PE if negative in low-risk patients; arterial blood gases), imaging (CT pulmonary angiography - CTPA, is the primary diagnostic test; ventilation-perfusion - V/Q scan if CTPA contraindicated; echocardiogram to assess heart strain), and EKG.",

This eosinophilic inflammation in the lungs can cause various respiratory symptoms. Causes are diverse: 1) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): Allergic reaction to *Aspergillus* fungus, often in people with asthma or cystic fibrosis. 2) Drug reactions: Many medications can trigger eosinophilic lung disease (e.g., NSAIDs, some antibiotics like nitrofurantoin/penicillins/sulfonamides, anticonvulsants). 3) Parasitic infections: e.g., roundworms like *Ascaris*, hookworms, *Strongyloides*, filarial worms (Löffler's syndrome is a transient form often due to migrating larvae). 4) Fungal infections other than *Aspergillus*. 5) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome): A systemic vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. 6) Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias: Cause unknown. Includes: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP - rapid onset, often severe, can mimic ARDS, sometimes linked to new smoking/toxin inhalation), Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP - more gradual onset, often in women, good response to steroids but can relapse), Simple pulmonary eosinophilia (Löffler's syndrome, if idiopathic), and Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES - persistent high eosinophil counts with organ involvement, can affect lungs). Symptoms vary depending on cause/type but can include: cough (often dry, can be productive), shortness of breath (dyspnea), wheezing, chest pain or discomfort, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.

Acute exacerbations can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring (fibrosis) and thickening of the lung tissue, particularly the interstitium (the tissue surrounding the air sacs). This scarring makes the lungs stiff and less elastic, impairing their ability to expand and transfer oxygen into the bloodstream effectively. There are many known causes of PF (secondary PF), including: long-term exposure to certain environmental or occupational toxins/dusts (e.g., asbestos, silica, coal dust, bird/animal droppings - leading to pneumoconiosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis), radiation therapy to the chest, certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin, bleomycin), autoimmune/connective tissue diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus, Sjögren's), and some infections. When no identifiable cause is found, it's termed Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF - see separate entry, as it's a specific and often more aggressive form). Other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) can also lead to fibrosis. The hallmark symptoms of PF are: progressive shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially with exertion, then later at rest; a persistent, dry, hacking cough; fatigue; unexplained weight loss; and sometimes clubbing of the fingers and toes (rounding and widening of tips). The course of PF is variable; for some, it progresses slowly over years, while for others (like IPF), it can be more rapid.",

Acute decompensation can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious condition characterized by abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries that carry blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs (pulmonary arteries). This increased pressure makes it harder for the right ventricle of the heart to pump blood through the lungs, leading to right heart strain and eventually right heart failure (cor pulmonale). PH is classified into 5 groups based on cause: Group 1 (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - PAH): Includes idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH, drug/toxin-induced PAH, and PAH associated with conditions like connective tissue diseases, HIV, congenital heart disease, or portal hypertension. Group 2: PH due to left heart disease (most common cause of PH overall - e.g., left ventricular failure, mitral or aortic valve disease). Group 3: PH due to chronic lung diseases and/or hypoxia (e.g., COPD, interstitial lung disease, sleep apnea, chronic high-altitude exposure). Group 4: PH due to chronic thromboembolism (CTEPH - blood clots in pulmonary arteries). Group 5: PH with unclear or multifactorial mechanisms. Symptoms often develop gradually and can be non-specific initially, including: shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with exertion; fatigue; weakness; chest pain or pressure (angina); dizziness or fainting (syncope); palpitations or irregular heartbeat; swelling (edema) in ankles, legs, or abdomen (ascites); and sometimes a dry cough or bluish lips/skin (cyanosis).",

Severe, symptomatic pulmonic stenosis or regurgitation can require intervention.",
    "general_advice": "Pulmonic valve disease (or pulmonary valve disease) affects the pulmonic valve, which is located between the right ventricle (lower right chamber of the heart) and the pulmonary artery. It has three leaflets and opens to allow deoxygenated blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs (to pick up oxygen), and closes to prevent blood from flowing backward. Pulmonic valve disease can be: 1) Pulmonic stenosis (PS): Narrowing of the pulmonic valve opening, restricting blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. This forces the right ventricle to work harder to pump blood, which can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy (thickening) and eventually right heart failure. PS is most often congenital (present at birth, can be isolated or part of complex defects like Tetralogy of Fallot). Acquired PS is rare (e.g., from carcinoid syndrome, rheumatic fever). Mild PS may be asymptomatic. Moderate to severe PS can cause fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, dizziness, fainting, and cyanosis (if severe and associated with right-to-left shunting). 2) Pulmonic regurgitation (PR, pulmonary insufficiency): The valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to leak backward from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle after it contracts. Mild PR is common and often benign. Significant PR can occur after surgical repair of PS or Tetralogy of Fallot, or due to pulmonary hypertension, infective endocarditis, carcinoid syndrome, or connective tissue diseases. Severe PR can lead to right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction, causing symptoms of right heart failure.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has symptoms suggestive of pulmonic valve disease, or if a heart murmur is detected, consult a doctor (pediatrician, primary care, or cardiologist/pediatric cardiologist).

    "emergency_advice": "Pyloric stenosis can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition if not treated promptly. Seek immediate medical attention if an infant (usually between 2-8 weeks old) develops: persistent, forceful, projectile vomiting (non-bilious - not green) shortly after feedings, which may worsen over time; persistent hunger despite vomiting; poor weight gain or weight loss; signs of dehydration (e.g., dry mouth, fewer wet diapers, sunken fontanelle/soft spot, lethargy); or decreased activity. This requires surgical correction.",
    "general_advice": "Pyloric stenosis, specifically infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), is a condition affecting young infants where the pylorus, the muscular valve at the lower end of the stomach that connects to the small intestine (duodenum), becomes thickened and narrowed (stenosed). This blocks food from passing from the stomach into the small intestine. It's one of the most common causes of intestinal obstruction in infancy, typically presenting between 2 and 8 weeks of age (can occur up to 6 months). It's more common in males (especially first-born) and may have a genetic component. The exact cause is unknown. The hallmark symptom is progressive, projectile vomiting (forceful, often shooting several feet) of non-bilious (not green or yellow) milk or formula, usually starting around 3-5 weeks of age. The baby is often hungry immediately after vomiting and eager to feed again. Other symptoms include poor weight gain or weight loss, dehydration, lethargy, fewer bowel movements, and sometimes visible peristaltic waves (wave-like contractions) across the upper abdomen after feeding, or a palpable olive-shaped mass (the thickened pylorus) in the upper right abdomen (though this is not always felt).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If your infant has persistent, forceful vomiting, especially if it's projectile and they seem constantly hungry, consult your pediatrician immediately. Diagnosis is often made based on history and physical exam. An abdominal ultrasound is usually the preferred imaging test to confirm pyloric muscle thickening. Sometimes an upper GI series (barium X-ray) may be done.",

Also, if symptoms are new and rapidly worsening, to rule out underlying causes.",
    "general_advice": "Raynaud's phenomenon (or Raynaud's disease when primary) is a condition characterized by episodic vasospasm (narrowing of small blood vessels) in the extremities, most commonly affecting the fingers and toes, but can also affect the nose, ears, lips, or nipples. This vasospasm restricts blood flow, causing the affected areas to temporarily change color and feel numb or cold. The classic color changes occur in three phases (though not everyone experiences all three): 1) Pallor (white): Due to reduced blood flow. 2) Cyanosis (blue): Due to deoxygenation of trapped blood. 3) Rubor (red): As blood flow returns (reperfusion), often with throbbing, tingling, or pain. Attacks are typically triggered by exposure to cold temperatures or emotional stress. There are two types: 1) Primary Raynaud's disease: Most common, occurs without an underlying medical condition. Symptoms are usually milder. 2) Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: Caused by an underlying condition, medication, or environmental factor. Associated conditions include: connective tissue diseases (e.g., scleroderma - very common, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome), arterial diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis, Buerger's disease), carpal tunnel syndrome, repetitive trauma (e.g., from vibrating tools - vibration white finger), smoking, certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers, some migraine drugs, chemotherapy agents, stimulants), or thyroid disorders. Secondary Raynaud's can be more severe and have higher risk of complications like skin ulcers or gangrene.",

    "general_advice": "Reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body, typically the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., from *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, *Campylobacter*, *Yersinia*) or the genitourinary tract (e.g., from *Chlamydia trachomatis* or other sexually transmitted infections, or sometimes UTIs). The arthritis usually appears 1-4 weeks after the initial infection, even if the infection itself was mild or asymptomatic and has resolved. The joints themselves are not infected, but the body's immune system, while fighting the infection, mistakenly also attacks the joints and sometimes other tissues. The classic triad of symptoms (formerly Reiter's syndrome) is arthritis, urethritis (inflammation of urethra, causing painful/frequent urination or discharge), and conjunctivitis/uveitis (eye inflammation), though not all three are always present ('can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree'). Arthritis typically affects a few joints (oligoarthritis), often asymmetrically, commonly in the lower limbs (knees, ankles, feet). Other symptoms can include: enthesitis (inflammation where tendons/ligaments attach to bone, e.g., Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis), dactylitis ('sausage digits' - swelling of entire finger/toe), low back pain (sacroiliitis), skin rashes (e.g., keratoderma blennorrhagicum - waxy, scaly rash on soles/palms), mouth sores, and nail changes. Reactive arthritis is more common in individuals with a specific genetic marker (HLA-B27).",

Symptoms typically: 1) Begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as sitting or lying down. 2) Are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues. 3) Are generally worse in the evening or at night than during the day, or only occur in the evening/night. These symptoms can make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep, leading to insomnia, daytime fatigue, and impaired quality of life. The exact cause of RLS is often unknown (idiopathic RLS), but it can have a genetic component (familial RLS).

Prompt surgical treatment is usually required to prevent permanent vision loss.",
    "general_advice": "Retinal detachment occurs when the retina, the thin, light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye, pulls away or separates from its normal position (from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, which supply it with oxygen and nutrients). If not reattached quickly, the retinal cells can be deprived of oxygen and die, leading to irreversible vision loss. There are three main types: 1) Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD - most common): Caused by a tear or hole in the retina, which allows vitreous fluid (the gel filling the eye) to seep underneath and lift the retina off. Often preceded by posterior vitreous detachment (PVD - common age-related process where vitreous gel shrinks and pulls away from retina, sometimes causing a tear). 2) Tractional retinal detachment (TRD): Caused by scar tissue (fibrovascular membranes) on the retinal surface contracting and pulling the retina away. Often seen in conditions like diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, or previous eye trauma/surgery. 3) Exudative (serous) retinal detachment (ERD): Caused by fluid accumulating under the retina without a tear or hole, due to inflammation, tumors, or vascular abnormalities. Risk factors for RRD include: high myopia (nearsightedness), previous cataract surgery, eye trauma, family history of retinal detachment, previous retinal detachment in other eye, and certain retinal thinning conditions (e.g., lattice degeneration).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate ophthalmological evaluation is crucial if symptoms of retinal detachment occur. Diagnosis involves a dilated eye exam to visualize the retina. Ultrasound of the eye may be used if view is obscured (e.g., by vitreous hemorrhage).",

High levels of myoglobin can be toxic to the kidneys and cause acute kidney injury (AKI) or failure. Elevated potassium (hyperkalemia) can cause dangerous heart rhythm problems. Causes of rhabdomyolysis are diverse and can include: 1) Trauma or crush injuries: Severe muscle damage from accidents, crush syndrome, prolonged immobilization (e.g., after a fall and being unable to get up). 2) Extreme physical exertion: Especially in untrained individuals, in hot/humid conditions, or with dehydration (e.g., marathon running, intense weightlifting, military training). 3) Medications: Statins (cholesterol drugs - rare but serious side effect), antipsychotics (can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which can lead to rhabdo), certain antibiotics, colchicine, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, alcohol. 4) Toxins or venoms: e.g., snakebites, insect stings, certain mushroom poisoning. 5) Infections: Viral (influenza, HIV, herpes), bacterial (sepsis, legionella). 6) Electrolyte imbalances: Severe hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia. 7) Temperature extremes: Heatstroke, hypothermia, malignant hyperthermia. 8) Seizures or severe muscle spasms/dystonia. 9) Certain genetic muscle diseases.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if rhabdomyolysis is suspected. Diagnosis involves a medical history (looking for causes), physical exam, blood tests (creatine kinase - CK levels are usually very high, often >5-10 times upper limit of normal, or even thousands to hundreds of thousands; myoglobin; electrolytes - potassium, calcium, phosphate; kidney function - BUN, creatinine), and urine tests (for myoglobin - myoglobinuria).",

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child develops symptoms of acute rheumatic fever, especially if there's a recent history of untreated or inadequately treated strep throat or scarlet fever. Complications like severe carditis (heart inflammation) leading to heart failure, or Sydenham's chorea (neurological disorder) require prompt management. Severe joint pain or high fever also warrant urgent care.",
    "general_advice": "Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an inflammatory disease that can develop as a delayed complication of a Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacterial infection, such as strep throat or scarlet fever, if the infection is not treated promptly and adequately with antibiotics. ARF is an autoimmune reaction where the body's immune system, while fighting the strep infection, mistakenly also attacks its own tissues, particularly the heart, joints, brain, and skin. It typically occurs 2-4 weeks after the initial strep infection. Symptoms vary and are diagnosed based on the Jones Criteria (presence of major and/or minor manifestations plus evidence of preceding GAS infection). Major manifestations include: 1) Carditis: Inflammation of the heart muscle, lining, or valves (endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis). Can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, new heart murmur. This is the most serious complication as it can lead to permanent heart valve damage (Rheumatic Heart Disease - RHD, see separate entry). 2) Arthritis (polyarthritis): Painful, swollen, tender, red joints, often affecting large joints (knees, ankles, elbows, wrists), typically migratory (moves from one joint to another). 3) Sydenham's chorea (St. Vitus' dance): A neurological disorder causing rapid, jerky, involuntary movements, often of face, hands, feet; muscle weakness; and emotional lability. Can appear weeks to months after strep infection. 4) Erythema marginatum: A characteristic non-itchy rash with pink/red rings or wavy lines, often on trunk/limbs. 5) Subcutaneous nodules: Small, painless, firm lumps under skin, usually over bony prominences or tendons. Minor manifestations include fever, joint pain (arthralgia without arthritis), elevated inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), and EKG changes (prolonged PR interval). ARF primarily affects children and adolescents (ages 5-15) in areas with high rates of strep throat and limited access to healthcare, but can occur at any age.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If symptoms of ARF develop, especially after a recent sore throat, consult a doctor immediately. Diagnosis is based on Jones Criteria, evidence of recent GAS infection (e.g., positive throat culture or rapid strep test during illness, or elevated strep antibody titers like ASO/anti-DNase B), and ruling out other conditions. Management often involves pediatricians, cardiologists, and rheumatologists.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "ARF requires medical treatment to eradicate any residual strep infection, reduce inflammation, and prevent cardiac damage.",
      "  - Antibiotics: A course of antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) is given to eliminate any remaining GAS bacteria, even if throat culture is negative at time of ARF diagnosis.",
      "  - Anti-inflammatory medications: Aspirin (used cautiously in children due to Reye's syndrome risk, but standard for ARF arthritis/carditis under medical supervision) or NSAIDs for joint pain/inflammation. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) for moderate to severe carditis.",
      "  - Bed rest: May be recommended during acute phase, especially if carditis is present.",
      "  - Management of chorea (if present): May involve medications like sedatives or anticonvulsants. Usually resolves over time.",
      "  - Management of heart failure (if carditis is severe).",
      "Secondary prophylaxis (prevention of recurrent ARF) is crucial: Long-term, continuous antibiotic therapy (usually monthly penicillin injections or daily oral penicillin) is given for many years (often until young adulthood or sometimes lifelong, depending on presence/severity of RHD) to prevent further strep infections and recurrent ARF, which can worsen heart valve damage. Adherence is vital.",

Sudden, severe worsening of symptoms also warrants prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, primarily the synovium (the lining of the membranes that surround joints). This causes inflammation, leading to pain, swelling, stiffness (often worse in the morning or after inactivity, lasting >30-60 minutes), warmth, and redness in affected joints. If inflammation persists, it can damage cartilage, bone, ligaments, and tendons, leading to joint deformity and loss of function. RA typically affects joints symmetrically (e.g., both wrists, both knees). Small joints of the hands (knuckles, middle finger joints) and feet are commonly involved, but it can affect almost any joint. RA can also cause systemic symptoms like fatigue, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and can affect other organs (e.g., skin - rheumatoid nodules, eyes - dry eyes/scleritis, lungs - interstitial lung disease/pleuritis, heart - pericarditis/increased cardiovascular risk, blood vessels - vasculitis). The exact cause is unknown but involves genetic predisposition and environmental factors (e.g., smoking, infections). It's more common in women and often begins in middle age, but can occur at any age.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, especially if symmetrical and involving multiple joints, consult your doctor (primary care or rheumatologist). Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to control inflammation, relieve symptoms, prevent joint damage, and maintain function. Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam (looking for swollen, tender joints), blood tests (for inflammatory markers like ESR/CRP, rheumatoid factor - RF, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies - anti-CCP/ACPA - which are more specific for RA), and imaging (X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI to assess joint damage).",

Also, if a severe, uncontrolled flare-up of skin rosacea is causing extreme distress or disfigurement (e.g., severe rhinophyma development).",
    "general_advice": "Rosacea is a common, chronic inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the central face (cheeks, nose, chin, forehead). It's characterized by recurrent episodes of flushing or blushing, persistent facial redness (erythema), visible tiny blood vessels (telangiectasias or 'spider veins'), and sometimes inflammatory papules (small red bumps) and pustules (pus-filled pimples - often mistaken for acne, hence 'acne rosacea'). In some cases, particularly in men, rosacea can lead to rhinophyma, a thickening and enlargement of the skin on the nose, making it appear bulbous. Rosacea can also affect the eyes (ocular rosacea), causing dryness, irritation, redness, burning, stinging, light sensitivity, and inflamed eyelids (blepharitis). The exact cause is unknown but involves a combination of genetic predisposition, immune system dysregulation, neurovascular dysregulation (abnormal blood vessel function), and possibly environmental triggers or microorganisms (like *Demodex* mites on skin). Symptoms often fluctuate and can be triggered or worsened by factors like sun exposure, hot/cold weather, wind, stress, hot drinks, spicy foods, alcohol (especially red wine), certain skincare products, or exercise.",

While most rotator cuff issues are not acute emergencies, a traumatic full-thickness tear may benefit from earlier surgical evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "A rotator cuff injury involves damage to one or more of the four rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis) or their tendons, which surround the shoulder joint. These muscles and tendons help to stabilize the shoulder, rotate and lift the arm, and allow for a wide range of motion. Injuries can range from: 1) Rotator cuff tendinitis (inflammation of a tendon, often due to overuse or impingement - where tendons rub against bone). 2) Rotator cuff impingement syndrome: Tendons get compressed or 'pinched' in the subacromial space (between acromion bone and humeral head), often during overhead activities. Can lead to tendinitis or bursitis. 3) Rotator cuff tear: A partial or full-thickness tear in one or more tendons. Can occur acutely from an injury (e.g., fall, sudden lift) or develop gradually over time due to degeneration, overuse, or repetitive stress (common in older adults or those with overhead occupations/sports). Symptoms depend on the type and severity of injury but often include: pain in the shoulder (can be dull ache or sharp, often felt on outer aspect of shoulder or radiating down arm), pain that worsens with specific movements (especially lifting arm overhead, reaching behind back, or lying on affected shoulder at night), weakness in the arm (difficulty lifting or rotating arm), limited range of motion, and sometimes a clicking or popping sensation. Night pain is common.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent shoulder pain, weakness, or limited motion that interferes with daily activities or sleep, consult your doctor (primary care, sports medicine, or orthopedist).

    "general_advice": "Salivary gland disorders are conditions affecting the salivary glands, which produce saliva to moisten the mouth, aid digestion, and protect teeth. There are three pairs of major salivary glands (parotid - in front of ears, submandibular - under jaw, sublingual - under tongue) and numerous minor salivary glands throughout the mouth. Disorders can cause swelling, pain, dry mouth (xerostomia), or altered taste. Common types include: 1) Sialadenitis: Inflammation/infection of a salivary gland, often bacterial (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*) or viral (e.g., mumps - see separate entry). Can be acute or chronic. Causes painful swelling, redness, tenderness, fever, and sometimes pus draining from duct opening in mouth. 2) Sialolithiasis (Salivary Stones): Calculi (stones) form within salivary ducts, most commonly in submandibular gland duct. Can block saliva flow, causing pain and swelling, especially before or during meals (when saliva production increases). 3) Salivary Gland Tumors: Can be benign (most common, e.g., pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor - often in parotid) or malignant (e.g., mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma - rarer). Present as a lump or swelling, may be painless or painful, can sometimes cause facial nerve weakness if parotid tumor is malignant. 4) Sjögren's Syndrome: Autoimmune disease causing dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes due to immune attack on salivary and lacrimal glands. Can also cause salivary gland enlargement. 5) Cysts: Fluid-filled sacs (e.g., mucocele - common on lower lip from minor salivary gland duct blockage/rupture). 6) Sialadenosis: Non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic, often bilateral, diffuse enlargement of salivary glands, sometimes associated with systemic conditions (diabetes, alcoholism, malnutrition, certain drugs).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent salivary gland swelling, pain, dry mouth, a lump in the gland area, or other concerning symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care, dentist, or ENT specialist/oral surgeon). Diagnosis involves a physical exam, and may include imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI, sialography - X-ray with dye in ducts), sialendoscopy (thin scope into ducts), biopsy (fine-needle aspiration or surgical biopsy for tumors), or blood tests (for autoimmune markers, infection).",

    "general_advice": "Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of tiny clumps of inflammatory cells called granulomas in one or more organs of the body. The exact cause is unknown, but it's thought to involve an abnormal immune response to an unknown trigger (e.g., infection, environmental factor) in genetically susceptible individuals. Sarcoidosis can affect almost any organ, but most commonly involves the lungs (pulmonary sarcoidosis - in >90% of cases) and lymph nodes (especially in chest - hilar lymphadenopathy). Other commonly affected organs include the skin, eyes (uveitis), liver, spleen, heart (cardiac sarcoidosis), nervous system (neurosarcoidosis), joints, and kidneys. Symptoms vary greatly depending on which organs are involved and the extent of inflammation/granuloma formation. Many people have no symptoms, and it's found incidentally on imaging. Common symptoms can include: persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, fatigue, fever, night sweats, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, skin rashes or lesions (e.g., erythema nodosum - tender red bumps on shins; lupus pernio - purplish plaques on nose/cheeks/ears; papules, plaques), eye redness/pain/blurred vision, joint pain/swelling, and sometimes palpitations or dizziness if heart is involved.",

    "general_advice": "Scabies is a highly contagious skin infestation caused by a tiny, eight-legged burrowing mite called *Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis*. The female mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin to lay her eggs, triggering an allergic reaction and intense itching. The hallmark symptom is severe itching (pruritus), which is often worse at night and after a hot bath/shower. A characteristic rash also occurs, consisting of small, red, pimple-like bumps (papules), tiny blisters (vesicles), or thin, wavy, thread-like burrows (short, S-shaped lines, often grayish-white or skin-colored - these are paths mite has tunneled). Common sites of infestation include the webs between fingers, wrists, elbows, armpits, belt line, nipples, around the navel, buttocks, and male genital area. In infants and young children, rash can also appear on face, scalp, neck, palms, and soles. Scabies is spread primarily by prolonged, direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person. It can also (less commonly) spread by sharing contaminated clothing, bedding, or towels. It's common in crowded conditions (e.g., nursing homes, dorms, childcare facilities).",

    "emergency_advice": "While scars themselves are not emergencies, seek medical attention if a healing wound or existing scar shows signs of: infection (redness, warmth, swelling, pain, pus, fever); dehiscence (wound opening up); or if a scar becomes extremely painful, itchy, or undergoes rapid, unusual changes in appearance (e.g., very rapid growth, bleeding, ulceration - could rarely indicate skin cancer developing in a chronic scar, though this is uncommon).",
    "general_advice": "A scar (cicatrix) is a mark left on the skin or within body tissue after a wound or injury has healed. It's a natural part of the body's healing process. When the dermis (deeper layer of skin) is damaged, the body forms new collagen fibers to mend the damage, resulting in a scar. The appearance of a scar depends on many factors, including the type and severity of the injury, its location, the person's age, genetics, skin type/color, and how the wound was treated. Most scars fade and become less noticeable over time, though they may never disappear completely. Types of scars include: 1) Fine line scars: From minor cuts or well-repaired surgical incisions; often heal as a thin line. 2) Atrophic scars: Sunken or pitted appearance, due to loss of underlying tissue (e.g., acne scars, chickenpox scars). 3) Hypertrophic scars: Raised, red, and thickened scars that remain within the boundaries of the original wound. May be itchy or painful. Can improve over time. 4) Keloid scars: Overly aggressive healing response where scar tissue grows beyond the boundaries of the original wound. Raised, firm, often itchy or painful, and can be much larger than the initial injury. More common in darker skin types. Can recur after removal. 5) Contracture scars: Often from burns, where skin tightens and pulls together, restricting movement, especially if over a joint.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most minor scars don't require medical treatment. However, consult a doctor or dermatologist if a scar is: causing significant cosmetic concern, itchy or painful, restricting movement (contracture), very large or disfiguring, or if you are prone to keloids or hypertrophic scars and want to discuss prevention or treatment options.

    "general_advice": "Scarlet fever (scarlatina) is a bacterial illness that develops in some people who have strep throat (Group A Streptococcus - GAS - infection). It's characterized by a distinctive sandpaper-like red rash that typically starts on the neck, chest, and armpits, then spreads to the rest of the body. The rash feels rough, blanches (turns white) with pressure, and may be itchy. Other symptoms are similar to strep throat and include: sore throat (often severe, red, with white/yellow patches on tonsils), fever (often high, 101°F/38.3°C or higher), chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, swollen lymph nodes in neck, and a flushed face with a pale area around the mouth (circumoral pallor). The tongue may initially have a white coating, then become red and bumpy ('strawberry tongue'). After the rash fades (usually in about a week), the skin on fingertips, toes, and groin may peel. Scarlet fever is most common in children aged 5-15 but can affect anyone. It's contagious and spread through respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing) or direct contact.",

    "general_advice": "Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which is the longest and largest nerve in the body. The sciatic nerve branches from the lower back (lumbar and sacral spine) through the hips and buttocks and down each leg, to the foot. Sciatica is a symptom of an underlying problem that is irritating or compressing the sciatic nerve or one of its nerve roots in the lower spine. The most common cause is a herniated lumbar disc (slipped disc - see separate entry) that presses on a nerve root. Other causes include: lumbar spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal), degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis (vertebra slips forward), piriformis syndrome (spasm or tightness of piriformis muscle in buttock compressing sciatic nerve), bone spurs, spinal tumors (rare), or trauma. Sciatic pain is often described as sharp, burning, shooting, or electric-shock-like. It typically affects only one side of the body and can range from a mild ache to excruciating pain. It may also be accompanied by numbness, tingling (paresthesias), or muscle weakness in the affected leg or foot. Pain can be worsened by sitting, coughing, sneezing, or straining.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have sciatic pain that is severe, persistent (lasts more than a few weeks), or associated with significant weakness, numbness, or if you have any 'red flag' symptoms (see emergency advice), consult your doctor (primary care, physiatrist, orthopedist, or neurosurgeon).

Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications like uveitis, glaucoma, cataracts, or scleral thinning/perforation.",
    "general_advice": "Scleritis is a serious inflammatory disease affecting the sclera, the tough, white outer layer of the eyeball. It can involve the anterior sclera (front part, most common) or posterior sclera (back part, less common, harder to diagnose). Scleritis is often associated with underlying systemic autoimmune or connective tissue diseases in about 50% of cases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis - GPA/Wegener's, inflammatory bowel disease, relapsing polychondritis, sarcoidosis). It can also be caused by infections (e.g., herpes zoster, syphilis, tuberculosis - rare), or be idiopathic (unknown cause). Symptoms vary by type and severity (see emergency advice). Anterior scleritis can be diffuse (widespread redness/inflammation), nodular (a firm, tender, immovable nodule), or necrotizing (most severe, can lead to scleral thinning and perforation, often with extreme pain and vision loss).

    "general_advice": "Scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis (SSc), is a chronic, rare autoimmune disease characterized by hardening and tightening (fibrosis) of the skin and connective tissues. 'Sclero' means hard, 'derma' means skin. The immune system triggers an overproduction of collagen, leading to scarring and thickening. Scleroderma can be: 1) Localized scleroderma: Primarily affects the skin, sometimes underlying muscle/bone, but not internal organs. Includes morphea (patches of hard skin) and linear scleroderma (bands of hard skin, can affect joints/growth in children). 2) Systemic sclerosis (SSc): Affects skin AND internal organs, such as lungs, heart, kidneys, esophagus, and intestines. SSc is further divided into: Limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc, formerly CREST syndrome - Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly - tight skin on fingers, Telangiectasias - spider veins). Skin thickening is usually limited to fingers, hands, face, forearms, lower legs. Internal organ involvement can occur but may be later or milder. Diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc): More widespread and often more rapid skin thickening (can affect trunk, upper arms/thighs), with higher risk of early and severe internal organ involvement (lungs, kidneys, heart, GI tract). Symptoms vary greatly depending on type and organs involved, but can include: Raynaud's phenomenon (see separate entry - often an early sign), skin thickening/tightening (can cause shiny skin, restricted movement, changes in facial appearance), joint pain/stiffness (arthralgia/arthritis), fatigue, heartburn/acid reflux, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), shortness of breath (from lung fibrosis or PAH), digestive problems (bloating, constipation, diarrhea, malabsorption), and finger/toe ulcers.

    "general_advice": "Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine (vertebral column), often with a rotational component, giving the spine an 'S' or 'C' shape when viewed from the back. It can occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in adolescence during growth spurts. Types include: 1) Idiopathic scoliosis (most common, about 80%): Cause is unknown. Subtypes based on age of onset (infantile, juvenile, adolescent - AIS is most frequent). More common in girls. 2) Congenital scoliosis: Due to vertebral abnormalities present at birth. 3) Neuromuscular scoliosis: Caused by underlying neurological or muscular conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, spinal cord injury). Often more progressive and severe. 4) Degenerative scoliosis (de novo scoliosis): Develops in older adults due to age-related wear and tear of spinal discs and facet joints. Mild scoliosis often causes no symptoms. As curvature increases, signs and symptoms can include: uneven shoulders, one shoulder blade more prominent than the other, uneven waistline or hips, leaning to one side, and sometimes back pain (more common in adults or with larger curves), fatigue, or in severe cases (>70-80 degrees), reduced lung capacity and shortness of breath. The severity of scoliosis is measured by the Cobb angle on an X-ray.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has signs of scoliosis (e.g., uneven shoulders/hips, visible spinal curve), consult a doctor (pediatrician, primary care, or orthopedic specialist/spine surgeon). School scoliosis screenings can sometimes detect it. Diagnosis involves a physical exam (e.g., Adams forward bend test - looking for rib hump or spinal asymmetry) and standing X-rays of the spine to measure the curve. Early detection allows for monitoring and intervention if needed to prevent progression.",

      "  - Bracing: For moderate curves (e.g., 25-45 degrees) in growing children/adolescents, a back brace (e.g., Boston brace, Milwaukee brace, Charleston bending brace) may be prescribed to try and prevent further progression of the curve until skeletal maturity. Braces need to be worn for many hours a day (e.g., 16-23 hours) and compliance is key. Bracing does not correct existing curve but aims to halt its worsening.",
      "  - Physical therapy: Specific scoliosis exercises (e.g., Schroth method, SEAS) may be used as an adjunct to bracing or for mild curves, to improve posture, core strength, and reduce pain, though evidence for significantly altering curve progression with exercise alone is limited for moderate/severe curves.",
      "  - Surgery (spinal fusion): Recommended for severe curves (e.g., >45-50 degrees, or smaller curves that are rapidly progressing or causing significant symptoms/functional impairment/cosmetic concern). Surgery involves straightening the spine as much as possible and fusing vertebrae together with bone grafts and instrumentation (rods, screws, hooks) to hold them in place while they heal into a solid bone mass. This can prevent further progression and improve deformity.",

Untreated severe scurvy can be fatal.",
    "general_advice": "Scurvy is a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that the human body cannot produce on its own and must obtain from diet. It plays a crucial role in collagen synthesis (important for connective tissues, blood vessels, skin, gums, bones), wound healing, iron absorption, and immune function, and is also an antioxidant. Severe vitamin C deficiency (usually after at least 1-3 months of very low or no intake) leads to impaired collagen production and weakened connective tissues, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of scurvy. Early symptoms can be vague: fatigue, weakness, irritability, loss of appetite, weight loss, and muscle/joint aches. As it progresses, more specific signs appear: swollen, bleeding, and spongy gums (gingivitis, can lead to tooth loss); easy bruising (ecchymoses); pinpoint bleeding spots under skin (petechiae); coiled or corkscrew body hairs; poor wound healing; dry, rough skin; joint pain and swelling (hemarthrosis); anemia; and sometimes depression or personality changes. In infants and children, scurvy can also cause bone pain, impaired bone growth, and irritability. Scurvy is rare in developed countries but can occur in individuals with very poor or restrictive diets (e.g., lacking fresh fruits and vegetables), alcohol use disorder, eating disorders, malabsorption syndromes, or in isolated/elderly individuals with poor access to nutritious food.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of scurvy, especially with risk factors for vitamin C deficiency, consult your doctor.

    "severity_level": "Low",
    "emergency_advice": "While not usually an emergency, seek urgent medical attention if allergic rhinitis symptoms are accompanied by: severe difficulty breathing, wheezing, or chest tightness (could be an asthma attack, as allergies can trigger asthma); or signs of a severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis (e.g., from a cross-reactive food or if it's not just seasonal allergies - though anaphylaxis from inhaled pollen is extremely rare). Also, if symptoms are severe and uncontrolled, or if complications like severe sinus infection develop.",
    "general_advice": "Seasonal allergies, commonly known as hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis, are an allergic reaction to airborne allergens (pollens) that are present only during certain times of the year, corresponding to the pollination seasons of specific trees, grasses, or weeds. When a person with seasonal allergies inhales these pollens, their immune system overreacts, releasing histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and allergy symptoms. Common symptoms include: sneezing (often in bouts), runny nose (rhinorrhea - usually clear, watery discharge), stuffy nose (nasal congestion), itchy nose, throat, eyes, and ears, watery, red, itchy eyes (allergic conjunctivitis - see separate entry), postnasal drip (mucus dripping down back of throat), cough (from postnasal drip or associated asthma), fatigue, and sometimes dark circles under eyes ('allergic shiners'). Symptoms tend to recur around the same time each year.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If seasonal allergy symptoms are bothersome, significantly impact your quality of life, or are not well-controlled with over-the-counter (OTC) medications, consult your doctor or an allergist. An allergist can perform skin prick tests or blood tests (specific IgE) to identify the specific pollens you are allergic to, which can help with avoidance strategies and targeted treatment. They can also rule out other conditions and manage associated problems like asthma or sinusitis.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management focuses on avoiding allergens (where possible) and relieving symptoms.",

An infected cyst may need incision and drainage and/or antibiotics.",
    "general_advice": "The term 'sebaceous cyst' is often used colloquially to refer to two common types of benign skin cysts: 1) Epidermoid cysts (epidermal inclusion cysts): These are more common. They form when epidermal (skin surface) cells, instead of shedding normally, get trapped underneath the skin and proliferate, forming a sac filled with keratin (a cheesy, often foul-smelling, protein material that makes up skin, hair, nails). They often have a central pore or punctum (a small dark spot). Can occur anywhere on body, common on face, neck, back, chest, scrotum. 2) Pilar cysts (trichilemmal cysts): Less common than epidermoid cysts. Arise from the outer root sheath of a hair follicle. Filled with keratin. Most commonly occur on the scalp (90%). Tend to be firmer, more mobile, and usually lack a central punctum. Often run in families. True sebaceous cysts (arising from sebaceous oil glands) are much rarer. All these cysts are typically slow-growing, round or dome-shaped, smooth, movable lumps under the skin. They are usually painless unless they become inflamed, infected, or rupture, which can cause pain, redness, swelling, and tenderness.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have a new skin lump or cyst, it's advisable to have it checked by a doctor (primary care or dermatologist) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.

      "  - Corticosteroid injection (intralesional): Can be used to reduce inflammation in a non-infected, inflamed cyst.",
      "  - Surgical excision: The most complete treatment, involving surgical removal of the entire cyst sac. This is usually done when the cyst is not acutely inflamed, and it has the lowest recurrence rate. Often done for cosmetic reasons, if cyst is bothersome, or if recurrently inflamed.",

    "general_advice": "Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects oily (sebaceous gland-rich) areas of the body, such as the scalp, face (especially eyebrows, sides of nose, behind ears, forehead), upper chest, back, and skin folds (armpits, groin, under breasts). It's characterized by red, itchy, greasy or dry, scaly patches or plaques. On the scalp, it can cause dandruff (mild form) or thicker, yellowish, greasy scales (cradle cap in infants). The exact cause is not fully understood but is thought to involve an overgrowth of a type of yeast (fungus) called *Malassezia* (which normally lives on skin) and an abnormal immune/inflammatory response to it, combined with factors like skin oil production, genetic predisposition, stress, hormonal changes, and certain neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease) or immune deficiencies (e.g., HIV/AIDS). It's not contagious and not due to poor hygiene. Symptoms can fluctuate, with periods of flare-ups and remission, and may be worse in cold, dry weather or with stress.",

This is to rule out skin cancer, especially melanoma, which can sometimes be mistaken for or arise near an SK. Any suspicious skin lesion needs evaluation by a dermatologist.",
    "general_advice": "A seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a very common, benign (non-cancerous) skin growth that often appears in middle age or later. They are sometimes called 'age spots' or 'senile warts,' though they are not true warts (which are caused by HPV). SKs can occur almost anywhere on the body except palms and soles. They typically look like waxy, scaly, slightly raised growths that can vary in color from light tan or yellowish to dark brown or black. They often have a 'stuck-on' or 'pasted-on' appearance, as if they could be easily picked off (but don't try to). They can range in size from very small to over an inch across. SKs can be solitary or multiple. The exact cause is unknown, but genetics (often run in families) and aging are factors. Sun exposure may play a role in some. They are not contagious. While usually asymptomatic, they can sometimes become irritated, itchy, or inflamed, especially if rubbed by clothing.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop new skin growths, it's always best to have them checked by a doctor or dermatologist to confirm they are benign SKs and not something more serious like skin cancer.

It's the most common type of permanent hearing loss. SNHL often affects the ability to hear soft sounds and can also impair speech clarity (sounds may be audible but distorted or difficult to understand, especially in noisy environments). It can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life. Causes are diverse: 1) Aging (Presbycusis - most common cause, see separate entry). 2) Noise exposure (Noise-Induced Hearing Loss - NIHL): Prolonged exposure to loud noise or a single very loud acoustic trauma. 3) Genetic factors: Many inherited forms of hearing loss. 4) Infections: Viral (e.g., measles, mumps, cytomegalovirus - CMV, herpes zoster) or bacterial (e.g., meningitis). 5) Ototoxic medications: Certain drugs that can damage inner ear (e.g., some antibiotics like aminoglycosides, chemotherapy agents like cisplatin, high-dose aspirin, loop diuretics). 6) Head trauma or ear trauma. 7) Meniere's disease (can cause fluctuating SNHL). 8) Tumors affecting auditory nerve (e.g., vestibular schwannoma/acoustic neuroma). 9) Autoimmune inner ear disease. 10) Idiopathic (unknown cause, e.g., SSHL). SNHL can be unilateral or bilateral, and range from mild to profound (deafness).",

It's not the infection itself, but the body's extreme, overwhelming, and often harmful immune response to an infection that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. Any type of infection (bacterial - most common, viral, fungal, or parasitic) anywhere in the body can trigger sepsis. Common sources of infection leading to sepsis include: lungs (pneumonia), urinary tract (UTI/pyelonephritis), abdomen (e.g., appendicitis, diverticulitis, peritonitis, bowel perforation, gallbladder infection), skin (cellulitis, infected wounds or burns), bloodstream (bacteremia), or central nervous system (meningitis). Septic shock is a severe form of sepsis where there are profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, characterized by persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, despite fluid resuscitation, and signs of organ dysfunction. Individuals at higher risk for sepsis include: older adults (≥65), infants (<1 year), people with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, on immunosuppressive drugs), people with chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, lung disease), people with recent surgery or hospitalization, or those with invasive medical devices (catheters, IV lines).",

It's usually caused by bacteria (most common, e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus* species, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* - causing gonococcal arthritis), but can also be caused by viruses or fungi (less common, often in immunocompromised individuals). Bacteria can enter the joint through: 1) Hematogenous spread: From an infection elsewhere in the body traveling through the bloodstream to the joint. 2) Direct inoculation: From a penetrating injury to the joint, joint surgery (e.g., joint replacement - prosthetic joint infection), or injection into the joint. 3) Contiguous spread: From an infection near the joint (e.g., osteomyelitis, skin abscess). Any joint can be affected, but large joints like the knee, hip, shoulder, wrist, and ankle are most common. Risk factors include: pre-existing joint disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout), prosthetic joints, recent joint surgery or injury, skin infections, intravenous (IV) drug use, weakened immune system (e.g., diabetes, HIV/AIDS, on immunosuppressive drugs), older age, and alcoholism.",

    "general_advice": "Shingles (herpes zoster) is a painful viral infection that causes a blistering rash, typically on one side of the body in a dermatomal pattern (following the path of a specific nerve). It's caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person has chickenpox, the virus remains dormant (inactive) in nerve cells near the spinal cord or brain. Years later, if the immune system is weakened (e.g., due to age, stress, illness, immunosuppressive medications, HIV/AIDS), the virus can reactivate and travel along nerve fibers to the skin, causing shingles. Symptoms usually begin with localized pain, burning, tingling, itching, or numbness in the area where the rash will appear (prodromal phase). This is followed 1-5 days later by a rash of red spots that quickly develop into fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), similar to chickenpox blisters but usually in a limited band or strip on one side of the body (e.g., on torso, face, arm, leg). The blisters then rupture, ooze, crust over, and heal, usually within 2-4 weeks. Fever, headache, fatigue, and light sensitivity may also occur. The most common complication of shingles is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is persistent nerve pain in the area of the rash that can last for months or even years after the rash has healed, and can be very debilitating. Other complications include ophthalmic zoster (if eye is involved), Ramsay Hunt syndrome (facial nerve involvement), bacterial skin infections, or neurological problems (rare).",

Can occur due to reduced saliva flow (e.g., from dehydration, certain medications, Sjögren's syndrome, radiation therapy, post-surgery) or obstruction of a salivary duct (e.g., by a salivary stone - sialolithiasis, or a stricture). Symptoms include sudden onset of painful swelling of the affected gland, tenderness, redness of overlying skin, fever, malaise, and sometimes pus draining from the duct opening in the mouth. 2) Viral infection: e.g., Mumps (causes parotitis - see separate entry), cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza. 3) Chronic recurrent sialadenitis: Repeated episodes of inflammation, often due to underlying issues like stones, strictures, or autoimmune conditions like Sjögren's syndrome. Can lead to scarring and reduced gland function. 4) Autoimmune sialadenitis: e.g., Sjögren's syndrome. 5) Sialolithiasis (salivary stones) itself can cause inflammation (see Gallstone entry for general stone concept, but these are in salivary system).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have painful swelling of a salivary gland, fever, or pus drainage, consult your doctor (primary care, dentist, or ENT specialist). Diagnosis is often clinical, but imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI, sialography) may be done to look for stones, abscesses, or other structural issues. A swab of any pus may be cultured.",

      "  - For acute bacterial sialadenitis: Antibiotics (oral or IV if severe). Pain relievers. Good hydration. Warm compresses to the affected gland. Gentle massage of the gland (towards duct opening). Sialogogues (things that stimulate saliva flow, like lemon drops, tart candy, or pilocarpine - if no obstruction) to help promote drainage.",
      "  - If an abscess forms, incision and drainage may be needed.",
      "  - If a salivary stone is causing obstruction and infection, it will need to be removed (see Sialolithiasis management under Salivary Gland Disorder).",

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms related to sick sinus syndrome are severe or cause: fainting (syncope) or near-fainting leading to injury; significant dizziness or lightheadedness impairing function; severe chest pain; shortness of breath; or signs of heart failure or stroke (as SSS can sometimes be associated with atrial fibrillation which increases stroke risk). Profound bradycardia or long sinus pauses can be life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Sick sinus syndrome (SSS), also known as sinus node dysfunction, is a group of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) caused by a malfunction of the sinoatrial (SA) node, the heart's natural pacemaker, which is located in the right atrium. The SA node normally initiates electrical impulses that regulate the heart rate and rhythm. In SSS, the SA node may fire too slowly (sinus bradycardia), fail to fire (sinus arrest or sinus pause), or the impulses may be blocked from leaving the SA node (sinoatrial exit block). SSS can also involve episodes of rapid heart rhythms (tachycardias), often atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, alternating with periods of slow heart rates (this combination is called tachy-brady syndrome). SSS is most common in older adults, often due to age-related fibrosis (scarring) or degeneration of the SA node. Other causes can include coronary artery disease, heart surgery, certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics), inflammatory conditions, or inherited factors. Many people with mild SSS have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are often related to the heart beating too slowly or too fast/irregularly, and can include: dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting (syncope) or near-fainting, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath (especially with exertion), chest pain or discomfort, palpitations (sensation of skipped, fluttering, or racing heartbeat), confusion or memory problems (due to reduced brain blood flow), and exercise intolerance.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms suggestive of SSS, consult your doctor (primary care or cardiologist/electrophysiologist). Diagnosis involves an EKG (electrocardiogram) to assess heart rhythm. Since SSS symptoms are often intermittent, longer-term monitoring with a Holter monitor (24-48 hours or longer), event recorder, or implantable loop recorder may be needed to capture the abnormal rhythms. An electrophysiology study (EPS) may sometimes be done.",
    "self_care_tips": [

      "  - If medications are contributing, adjusting or stopping them (under medical supervision) may help.",
      "  - Pacemaker implantation: This is the primary treatment for symptomatic bradycardia (slow heart rate) caused by SSS. A pacemaker is a small implanted device that monitors the heart rhythm and sends electrical impulses to make the heart beat at an appropriate rate if it's too slow.",
      "  - Medications for tachyarrhythmias (if present, e.g., atrial fibrillation): Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmic drugs may be used. A pacemaker may be needed in tachy-brady syndrome to allow for safe use of medications that slow the heart rate (as these could worsen the bradycardia component).",
      "  - Anticoagulants (blood thinners): If atrial fibrillation is present, to reduce stroke risk.",

    "severity_level": "High",
    "emergency_advice": "A sickle cell crisis or acute complication is a medical emergency. Seek immediate medical attention for: severe pain (vaso-occlusive crisis - VOC) that is not relieved by home management; fever (often a sign of infection, which can be life-threatening in SCD); acute chest syndrome (chest pain, fever, cough, shortness of breath, low oxygen - a leading cause of death); stroke symptoms (FAST - Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911); priapism (prolonged, painful erection); severe abdominal pain (could be splenic sequestration - rapid spleen enlargement, or other issues); sudden vision changes; or signs of severe anemia (extreme fatigue, pallor, shortness of breath, dizziness).",
    "general_advice": "Sickle cell anemia is the most common and often most severe form of sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. It's caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). When HbS releases oxygen, it can cause red blood cells to become rigid, sticky, and sickle-shaped (like a crescent moon). These sickle cells can block blood flow in small blood vessels, depriving tissues and organs of oxygen, leading to episodes of severe pain (vaso-occlusive crises - VOCs) and organ damage over time. Sickle cells also have a shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells (about 10-20 days vs. 120 days), leading to chronic anemia. SCD is autosomal recessive, meaning a child must inherit two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin gene (one from each parent) to have the disease (e.g., HbSS for sickle cell anemia). Individuals with one copy (sickle cell trait - HbAS) are usually asymptomatic carriers but can sometimes have complications in extreme conditions. Symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear in early childhood and can include: chronic anemia (fatigue, pallor, weakness), recurrent episodes of severe pain (VOCs - affecting bones, chest, abdomen, joints), swelling of hands and feet (dactylitis - often first sign in infants), frequent infections (due to spleen damage), delayed growth and puberty, vision problems (retinopathy), jaundice, and increased risk of stroke, acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, kidney disease, leg ulcers, gallstones, and priapism.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "SCD is often diagnosed through newborn screening programs. If not, or if symptoms develop, consult a doctor (pediatrician, hematologist specializing in SCD).

These symptoms indicate that the slow heart rate may be compromising blood flow to vital organs and could be dangerous.",
    "general_advice": "Sinus bradycardia is a type of slow heart rhythm where the sinoatrial (SA) node, the heart's natural pacemaker, fires at a rate slower than normal (typically defined as <60 beats per minute in adults, though 'normal' can vary). The rhythm is regular, and the electrical conduction through the heart is otherwise normal. Sinus bradycardia can be a normal finding in some individuals, especially young, healthy, athletic people (well-conditioned heart can pump more blood per beat, so doesn't need to beat as fast at rest) or during sleep. However, it can also be caused by underlying medical conditions or factors, including: Sick sinus syndrome (dysfunction of SA node - see separate entry), Ischemic heart disease or heart attack, Hypothyroidism, Hypothermia, Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., severe hyperkalemia), Increased vagal tone (e.g., from vomiting, straining, carotid sinus hypersensitivity), Certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics, opioids), Obstructive sleep apnea, or Increased intracranial pressure. Many people with sinus bradycardia are asymptomatic. If the heart rate is too slow to adequately perfuse the brain and other organs, symptoms can occur (see emergency advice).",

    "general_advice": "Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells. It's the most common type of cancer. The main types are: 1) Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC): Most common type. Arises from basal cells in epidermis. Slow-growing, rarely metastasizes, but can be locally destructive if untreated. Often appears as a pearly or waxy bump, flat flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion, or a sore that heals and then reopens, often on sun-exposed skin (face, ears, neck, scalp, shoulders, back). 2) Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): Second most common. Arises from squamous cells in epidermis. Can grow more quickly than BCC and has a higher (though still relatively low for most localized SCCs) potential to metastasize if untreated. Often appears as a firm, red nodule; a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface; or a sore that heals and reopens, often on sun-exposed skin (face, ears, lips, hands, arms, legs). Actinic keratosis (rough, scaly patch from sun exposure) is a common precancerous lesion for SCC. 3) Melanoma: Most serious type, arises from melanocytes (pigment cells) (see separate entry for Melanoma). Has a high potential to metastasize if not caught early. The primary cause of most skin cancers is excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds. Other risk factors include: fair skin that burns easily, history of sunburns, many moles or atypical moles (for melanoma), family history of skin cancer, weakened immune system, exposure to certain chemicals (e.g., arsenic), or radiation therapy.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice any new skin growth, a mole or spot that changes in size, shape, color, or texture, a sore that doesn't heal within 2-4 weeks, or any suspicious skin lesion, consult your doctor or dermatologist promptly.

    "general_advice": "A skin polyp, more commonly known as a skin tag or acrochordon, is a small, soft, benign (non-cancerous) skin growth that hangs off the skin, often on a thin stalk (peduncle). They are very common, especially as people age. Skin tags are typically flesh-colored or slightly darker and can vary in size from tiny (a few millimeters) to larger (up to a centimeter or more). They commonly occur in areas where skin rubs against skin or clothing, such as the neck, armpits (axillae), groin, under the breasts, and on eyelids. The exact cause is unknown, but friction, genetics, obesity, insulin resistance/diabetes, and hormonal changes (e.g., during pregnancy) may play a role. Skin tags are usually painless and harmless, but they can sometimes become irritated, snagged on clothing or jewelry, or be cosmetically bothersome.",

If trying to quit and experiencing severe depression or suicidal thoughts, seek urgent mental health care.",
    "general_advice": "Tobacco use disorder, or nicotine addiction, is a substance use disorder characterized by the compulsive use of tobacco products (cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco like chew/snuff, e-cigarettes/vapes containing nicotine) despite harmful consequences. Nicotine is a highly addictive psychoactive drug found in tobacco. It causes the release of dopamine in the brain, leading to pleasurable sensations and reinforcement of use. Regular use leads to tolerance (needing more to get same effect) and physical dependence, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when use is stopped or reduced (e.g., irritability, anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, increased appetite, insomnia, cravings). Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide, significantly increasing the risk of: numerous cancers (lung, mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, cervix, etc.), chronic lung diseases (COPD - emphysema, chronic bronchitis; asthma exacerbation), heart disease (coronary artery disease, heart attack), stroke, peripheral artery disease, complications during pregnancy (preterm birth, low birth weight, SIDS), and many other health problems.",

Any suicidal ideation requires immediate help.",
    "general_advice": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is an anxiety disorder characterized by intense, persistent fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. They fear that they will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (e.g., be humiliating, embarrassing, lead to rejection, or offend others). Common feared situations include: public speaking, meeting new people, interacting in social gatherings, eating or drinking in public, using public restrooms, or being observed while doing something. Exposure to these situations almost invariably provokes fear or anxiety, which is out of proportion to the actual threat posed. The feared situations are actively avoided or endured with intense fear/anxiety. This avoidance and distress significantly interfere with daily life, work, school, or relationships. Physical symptoms of anxiety may also occur in social situations (e.g., blushing, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, nausea, difficulty speaking). SAD often begins in adolescence. It's different from normal shyness; SAD involves a much more intense fear and impairment.",

Pathological fracture through a bone involved by sarcoma is also an emergency.",
    "general_advice": "Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in the soft tissues of the body, which connect, support, or surround other body structures. Soft tissues include muscles, fat, fibrous tissues, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves. Sarcomas can develop almost anywhere in the body, but are most common in the limbs (arms, legs), trunk (chest wall, abdomen, retroperitoneum - back of abdomen), and head/neck. There are many different subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (over 50), classified based on the type of cell they originate from (e.g., liposarcoma - from fat, leiomyosarcoma - from smooth muscle, rhabdomyosarcoma - from skeletal muscle, synovial sarcoma, angiosarcoma - from blood/lymph vessels, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor - MPNST). Symptoms vary depending on the tumor's size, location, and type. Often, the first sign is a painless or mildly tender lump or swelling that gradually enlarges. As it grows, it may cause pain (if pressing on nerves or bones), limited range of motion, or other symptoms related to its location (e.g., abdominal pain/fullness for retroperitoneal sarcoma, breathing problems for chest wall sarcoma). The cause of most soft tissue sarcomas is unknown, but risk factors can include: certain genetic syndromes (e.g., neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, retinoblastoma gene mutations), previous radiation therapy to an area, exposure to certain chemicals (e.g., vinyl chloride, arsenic, dioxins - links are not always strong), and chronic lymphedema (can lead to lymphangiosarcoma - rare).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you discover a new, persistent, or growing lump or swelling anywhere in your body, especially if it's deep-seated, larger than a golf ball (e.g., >5 cm), or painful, consult your doctor promptly. While most soft tissue lumps are benign (e.g., lipomas), it's crucial to rule out sarcoma. Diagnosis involves imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI - MRI is often best for soft tissue detail), and a biopsy (core needle biopsy or incisional/excisional biopsy) of the suspicious mass is essential to confirm diagnosis, determine subtype, and grade (aggressiveness). Staging (with CT chest, etc.) determines if it has spread.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment for soft tissue sarcoma is complex, often multidisciplinary (involving surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, rehabilitation specialists), and best managed at a specialized sarcoma center. Treatment depends on subtype, grade, stage, location, and patient's overall health.",
      "  - Surgery: Mainstay of treatment for localized sarcomas, aiming for wide local excision (removing tumor with a margin of surrounding healthy tissue). Limb-sparing surgery is often possible. Amputation is sometimes necessary for very large or invasive limb sarcomas.",
      "  - Radiation therapy: Often used before surgery (neoadjuvant) to shrink tumor and make it easier to remove, or after surgery (adjuvant) to kill any remaining cancer cells and reduce recurrence risk. Can also be used for unresectable tumors or palliative care.",
      "  - Chemotherapy: Role varies by sarcoma subtype. More effective for some (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma - though these are often considered bone sarcomas too, some high-grade adult sarcomas). May be used neoadjuvantly, adjuvantly, or for metastatic disease. Common agents include doxorubicin, ifosfamide.",

Also, if distress from somatic symptoms leads to suicidal thoughts or severe impairment in functioning.",
    "general_advice": "'Somatization disorder' was a term for a psychiatric condition characterized by a long history (starting before age 30) of multiple, recurrent, and clinically significant physical complaints (somatic symptoms) that could not be fully explained by a known medical condition, and that caused significant distress or impairment in functioning. Individuals often sought frequent medical care from multiple providers for these symptoms, which could involve various body systems (e.g., pain symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, sexual symptoms, pseudoneurological symptoms like weakness/paralysis/sensory loss). In the DSM-5, somatization disorder has been largely incorporated into the broader category of Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD). SSD is diagnosed when a person has one or more distressing or disruptive somatic symptoms, accompanied by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to these symptoms or associated health concerns (e.g., disproportionate and persistent thoughts about seriousness of symptoms, persistently high level of anxiety about health/symptoms, or excessive time/energy devoted to symptoms/health concerns). The focus is less on whether the symptoms are medically unexplained and more on the distress and impairment they cause, and the individual's psychological response to them.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are experiencing persistent, distressing physical symptoms that are not well-explained by medical tests or are causing significant anxiety and impairment, consult your doctor (primary care) and consider a referral to a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist) experienced in somatic symptom disorders. A thorough medical evaluation is important to rule out underlying physical illness, but once that's done, focusing on the psychological aspects is key.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management is often best approached with a collaborative care model involving primary care and mental health professionals. Treatment aims to improve quality of life, reduce distress, and improve functioning, rather than necessarily eliminating all physical symptoms.",

It can help individuals: identify and change unhelpful thoughts and beliefs about their symptoms and health; develop coping skills for managing physical symptoms and distress; reduce illness-related behaviors (e.g., excessive checking, reassurance seeking); and improve daily functioning. Mindfulness-based therapies can also be beneficial.",

This is to rule out more serious conditions like testicular torsion (a surgical emergency), epididymitis/orchitis (infection), or testicular cancer (though cancer is usually a firm, painless lump within the testicle itself, not separate like a spermatocele).",
    "general_advice": "A spermatocele, also known as an epididymal cyst, is a common, benign (non-cancerous), fluid-filled sac (cyst) that develops in the epididymis, the coiled tube located at the back and top of the testicle that stores and transports sperm. Spermatoceles are typically filled with a milky or cloudy fluid that may contain sperm (hence the name). They are usually small, smooth, firm, and located separate from but near the testicle, often at the top or head of the epididymis. Most spermatoceles are painless and cause no symptoms, and are often found incidentally during self-examination or a routine physical exam. The exact cause is often unknown but may be related to a blockage in one of the tubes that transport sperm. They can occur at any age after puberty but are more common in middle-aged men. Spermatoceles do not affect fertility and do not increase the risk of testicular cancer.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you discover any new lump or swelling in your scrotum, it's important to have it evaluated by a doctor (primary care or urologist) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other, more serious conditions (like testicular cancer, varicocele, hydrocele, hernia, or infection).

Significant anemia or jaundice always warrants prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited (usually autosomal dominant, but can be recessive) disorder of red blood cells (RBCs). It's caused by genetic defects in proteins that make up the RBC membrane skeleton, leading to a loss of membrane surface area. This causes the normally biconcave disc-shaped RBCs to become spherical (spherocytes). These spherocytes are less flexible, more fragile, and are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) as they pass through the spleen, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia. The severity of HS varies greatly, from asymptomatic or very mild to severe and transfusion-dependent. Common features include: 1) Anemia: Symptoms like fatigue, weakness, pallor, shortness of breath. 2) Jaundice: Yellowing of skin/eyes due to increased bilirubin from RBC breakdown (can be intermittent or chronic, often mild). 3) Splenomegaly: Enlarged spleen (due to its role in destroying spherocytes). 4) Gallstones (cholelithiasis): Common complication, especially in adolescence/adulthood, due to chronic high bilirubin levels (pigment stones). 5) Aplastic crises: Temporary shutdown of RBC production by bone marrow, often triggered by parvovirus B19 infection, leading to sudden, severe anemia. 6) Hemolytic crises: Episodes of increased RBC destruction, often triggered by infections.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If there is a family history of HS, or if a child or adult has unexplained anemia, jaundice, or an enlarged spleen, consult a doctor (pediatrician, primary care, or hematologist). Diagnosis involves a blood smear (shows spherocytes), complete blood count (anemia, high reticulocyte count), tests for hemolysis (elevated bilirubin, LDH; low haptoglobin), osmotic fragility test (spherocytes are more fragile in hypotonic solutions), and sometimes genetic testing or specialized tests like EMA binding test.",

    "general_advice": "Spina bifida is a congenital neural tube defect (NTD) that occurs when the neural tube (which develops into the brain and spinal cord) does not close completely during early pregnancy. This results in an opening or defect in the spinal column, and sometimes the spinal cord and its coverings (meninges) protrude through this opening. The severity and type of spina bifida vary: 1) Spina Bifida Occulta ('hidden' spina bifida - mildest form): A small gap in one or more vertebrae, but spinal cord and meninges are usually not affected. Often causes no symptoms and may go undetected, or may have subtle signs on overlying skin (e.g., dimple, tuft of hair, birthmark). Usually no neurological problems. 2) Meningocele: Meninges protrude through the vertebral opening, forming a fluid-filled sac on the back, but spinal cord is usually in its normal position and not severely damaged. May have minimal or no neurological deficits, or sometimes bowel/bladder problems. 3) Myelomeningocele (most common and severe form, often what people mean by 'spina bifida'): Both meninges and spinal cord (with nerves) protrude through the opening in the spine, forming a sac on the baby's back. This causes significant damage to the spinal cord and nerves, resulting in varying degrees of paralysis or weakness in legs, loss of sensation below the level of the defect, bowel and bladder dysfunction (neurogenic bladder/bowel), orthopedic problems (e.g., clubfeet, hip dislocations, scoliosis), and often hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in brain, requiring a shunt). Chiari II malformation (brainstem abnormality) is also common with myelomeningocele. The exact cause of NTDs is not fully understood but involves genetic and environmental factors. Folic acid deficiency before and during early pregnancy is a major risk factor.",

Spinal stenosis can occur in the lumbar spine (lower back - lumbar stenosis, most common) or cervical spine (neck - cervical stenosis). Thoracic stenosis is rare. The most common cause is age-related degenerative changes ('wear and tear') in the spine, such as: osteoarthritis (bone spurs - osteophytes - can grow into spinal canal/foramina), degenerative disc disease (discs can bulge or herniate, lose height), thickening of spinal ligaments (e.g., ligamentum flavum). Other less common causes include spinal injuries, tumors, congenital stenosis (born with a narrow canal), Paget's disease of bone, or achondroplasia. Symptoms of lumbar stenosis often include: pain, numbness, tingling, cramping, or weakness in the lower back, buttocks, and legs (often bilateral), which is typically worsened by standing or walking (neurogenic claudication or pseudoclaudication) and relieved by sitting, leaning forward, or lying down. Symptoms of cervical stenosis can include: neck pain, numbness/tingling/weakness in arms/hands, balance problems, difficulty with fine motor skills, and if spinal cord is compressed (cervical myelopathy), can also cause leg weakness, spasticity, and bowel/bladder dysfunction.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent back or neck pain with radiating symptoms, leg pain with walking that improves with rest/leaning forward, or other neurological symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care, physiatrist, orthopedist, or neurologist/neurosurgeon). Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam, and imaging (MRI is usually best to visualize spinal canal, nerves, discs; CT or X-rays for bone issues).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management is often conservative initially, unless severe neurological deficits or cauda equina syndrome are present.",
      "  - Pain relievers: NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), acetaminophen. Neuropathic pain medications (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin) or muscle relaxants may be prescribed.",
      "  - Physical therapy: Very important. Involves exercises to strengthen core/back/neck muscles, improve flexibility (especially flexion-based exercises for lumbar stenosis, as flexion can open up spinal canal), improve posture, and teach pain management strategies. May also include manual therapy or modalities.",
      "  - Activity modification: Avoid activities that worsen symptoms (e.g., prolonged standing/walking for lumbar stenosis, certain neck positions for cervical). Use assistive devices (cane, walker) if needed for balance/stability.",
      "  - Maintain a healthy weight.",
      "  - Good posture.",
      "Medical treatments:",
      "  - Epidural steroid injections: Can deliver anti-inflammatory medication near compressed nerves to provide temporary pain relief.",
      "  - Surgical decompression: If conservative treatment fails after an adequate trial (e.g., 3-6 months), or if there's progressive neurological deficit, significant functional impairment, or cauda equina syndrome. Surgery aims to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots (e.g., laminectomy - removing part of vertebra, foraminotomy - widening nerve root opening). Spinal fusion may sometimes be done if there's associated instability."

    "emergency_advice": "While SCAs are chronic, progressive disorders, seek urgent medical attention for acute complications: severe falls leading to injury (due to worsening ataxia); acute respiratory distress (if breathing muscles are affected in advanced stages or due to aspiration); severe dysphagia (swallowing difficulty) leading to choking or aspiration pneumonia; or acute worsening of neurological symptoms not typical for the usual progression. Also, if experiencing severe depression or suicidal thoughts related to the impact of the disorder.",
    "general_advice": "Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a group of heterogeneous, inherited (mostly autosomal dominant, but can be recessive or X-linked) neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive ataxia, which is a loss of coordination of muscle movements, affecting gait (walking), balance, speech (dysarthria), and eye movements (nystagmus, saccadic pursuit). SCAs are caused by degeneration of the cerebellum (the part of the brain responsible for coordinating movement) and sometimes the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. There are many different genetic types of SCA (e.g., SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease, SCA6, SCA7, etc.), each caused by a mutation in a different gene. The age of onset, specific symptoms, rate of progression, and associated features can vary widely depending on the SCA type and even within families with the same type. In addition to ataxia, other neurological symptoms can occur, such as muscle stiffness (spasticity), weakness, neuropathy (numbness/tingling), cognitive impairment, vision problems (e.g., SCA7 causes retinal degeneration), seizures (rare), or movement disorders like dystonia or parkinsonism. Some SCAs also have non-neurological manifestations.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or a family member develops progressive problems with balance, coordination, walking, speech, or eye movements, or if there's a family history of ataxia, consult a neurologist (preferably one specializing in movement disorders or neurogenetics). Diagnosis involves a neurological exam, detailed family history, MRI of the brain (may show cerebellar atrophy), and definitive diagnosis is usually made by genetic testing to identify the specific SCA gene mutation.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "There is currently no cure for most SCAs, and no treatments to slow or stop the underlying neurodegeneration for most types, though research is ongoing (e.g., gene therapies, RNA-targeting therapies are being investigated for some). Management is supportive, multidisciplinary, and aims to maximize function, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life.",

    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention if spondylitis is associated with: new or rapidly worsening neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, or paralysis in limbs, loss of bladder/bowel control - could indicate spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome); sudden, severe back or neck pain, especially after trauma (could be a fracture through inflamed/fused bone); or severe systemic symptoms (high fever, chills, profound illness - could indicate spinal infection like discitis/osteomyelitis or sepsis if part of a systemic inflammatory disease flare).",
    "general_advice": "Spondylitis is a general term for inflammation of the vertebrae (bones of the spine). It's often used more broadly to refer to inflammatory diseases affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints (where spine connects to pelvis). The most well-known type is Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS - see separate entry), which is a chronic inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the axial skeleton (spine, sacroiliac joints), leading to pain, stiffness, and potential fusion of vertebrae. Spondylitis can also be a feature of other spondyloarthropathies (SpA), such as: Psoriatic arthritis (arthritis associated with psoriasis), Reactive arthritis (arthritis after an infection), Enteropathic arthritis (arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease - Crohn's/ulcerative colitis), and Undifferentiated SpA. These conditions often share features like inflammatory back pain (worse with rest/in morning, improves with activity), sacroiliitis, enthesitis (inflammation where tendons/ligaments attach to bone), peripheral arthritis, uveitis (eye inflammation), and a genetic predisposition (HLA-B27 association). Infectious spondylitis (spondylodiscitis or vertebral osteomyelitis) is an infection of the vertebrae and/or intervertebral discs, usually bacterial (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*, tuberculosis - Pott's disease) or fungal, causing severe localized back pain, fever, and sometimes neurological deficits. Degenerative spondylosis (see separate entry) involves age-related wear and tear, not primarily inflammation, though inflammation can be a component.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent inflammatory-type back pain (especially if under age 45, insidious onset, morning stiffness >30 min, improves with exercise, not with rest), or other symptoms suggestive of spondylitis (e.g., sacroiliac pain, enthesitis, uveitis, peripheral arthritis, family history), consult your doctor (primary care or rheumatologist). Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam (assessing spinal mobility, sacroiliac tenderness, enthesitis), blood tests (inflammatory markers like ESR/CRP, HLA-B27), and imaging (X-rays of sacroiliac joints/spine may show sacroiliitis or syndesmophytes; MRI is more sensitive for early inflammation).",

    "general_advice": "Spondylolisthesis is a spinal condition where one vertebra (bone of the spine) slips forward (anterolisthesis) or backward (retrolisthesis - less common) in relation to the vertebra below it. It most commonly occurs in the lumbar spine (lower back), especially at L4-L5 or L5-S1 levels. The degree of slippage is graded (Grade I - up to 25% slip, to Grade IV - >75% slip, or Grade V - spondyloptosis, complete slip). Causes/types include: 1) Isthmic spondylolisthesis (most common in younger individuals/athletes): Due to a defect or fracture (spondylolysis) in the pars interarticularis (a small segment of bone connecting facet joints). Repetitive stress or hyperextension can cause this. 2) Degenerative spondylolisthesis (most common in older adults): Due to age-related wear and tear of intervertebral discs and facet joints, leading to instability and slippage. Often associated with spinal stenosis. 3) Congenital spondylolisthesis: Due to vertebral abnormalities present at birth. 4) Traumatic spondylolisthesis: From acute fracture/dislocation. 5) Pathological spondylolisthesis: Due to bone disease (e.g., tumor, Paget's disease) weakening the vertebra. Many people with mild spondylolisthesis are asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they can include: low back pain (often worse with activity, especially extension, and relieved by rest or flexion); pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness radiating down one or both legs (sciatica/radiculopathy, if nerve roots are compressed by the slipped vertebra or associated stenosis/disc herniation); tight hamstrings; and sometimes changes in posture or gait. In severe cases, neurological deficits can occur.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent low back pain, radiating leg pain, or neurological symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care, physiatrist, orthopedist, or neurosurgeon).

These could indicate acute severe nerve or spinal cord compression.",
    "general_advice": "Spondylosis is a broad, general term used to describe age-related degenerative changes ('wear and tear' or osteoarthritis) of the spine. It can affect the cervical (neck - cervical spondylosis), thoracic (mid-back - less common symptomatically), or lumbar (low back - lumbar spondylosis) spine. These degenerative changes can involve: 1) Degenerative disc disease: Intervertebral discs lose hydration, shrink, bulge, or herniate. 2) Osteophyte formation (bone spurs): Bony growths develop on vertebrae, often around facet joints or disc margins. 3) Facet joint arthropathy: Cartilage in the facet joints (small joints connecting vertebrae) wears down, leading to inflammation and pain. 4) Thickening of spinal ligaments. These changes can lead to neck or back pain and stiffness, and if they cause narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis - see separate entry) or neuroforamina (nerve root openings), they can compress the spinal cord (myelopathy) or nerve roots (radiculopathy), leading to radiating pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the limbs. Spondylosis is very common with aging, and many people with X-ray evidence of spondylosis have no symptoms.

    "general_advice": "A spontaneous abortion, commonly known as a miscarriage, is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week of gestation (after 20 weeks, it's considered a stillbirth). Miscarriage is very common, occurring in an estimated 10-20% of known pregnancies, with most happening in the first trimester (first 12 weeks). The most common cause (over 50%) is chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo or fetus that are incompatible with life. Other potential contributing factors can include: maternal age (risk increases with age), maternal health conditions (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases, uterine abnormalities, cervical insufficiency), infections, hormonal problems, smoking, alcohol or drug use, or severe trauma. Symptoms of a miscarriage typically include: vaginal bleeding (can range from light spotting to heavy bleeding), abdominal or pelvic cramping or pain (can be similar to menstrual cramps or more severe), and sometimes passage of tissue from the vagina. Some miscarriages occur without obvious symptoms and are only discovered on ultrasound (missed miscarriage - see separate entry). Types of miscarriage include: threatened (bleeding but cervix closed, pregnancy may continue), inevitable (bleeding and cramping with open cervix), incomplete (some pregnancy tissue passed, some remains in uterus), complete (all pregnancy tissue passed), and septic (infection in uterus after miscarriage).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are pregnant and experience any vaginal bleeding, cramping, or suspect you might be having a miscarriage, contact your doctor or obstetric provider immediately.

      "  - Surgical management: Dilation and curettage (D&C) or dilation and evacuation (D&E) - a procedure to remove remaining tissue from the uterus. Often done if bleeding is heavy, infection is present, or if expectant/medical management fails or is not preferred.",
      "Physical recovery: Expect some bleeding and cramping for a period after. Use pads, not tampons. Avoid intercourse and douching until cleared by your doctor. Pain relievers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen) can be used.",
      "Emotional recovery: Miscarriage can be a significant emotional loss for both partners. Allow yourself time to grieve. Seek support from your partner, family, friends, support groups (for pregnancy loss), or a counselor.

    "general_advice": "Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus *Sporothrix schenckii* (or related *Sporothrix* species). This fungus is commonly found in soil, sphagnum moss, hay, rose thorns, and other plant matter. Infection usually occurs when fungal spores enter the skin through a minor cut, scrape, or puncture wound (e.g., from a rose thorn, splinter, or cat scratch - hence 'rose gardener's disease'). There are different forms: 1) Cutaneous/Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis (most common): Typically starts as a small, painless, firm bump (nodule or papule) at the site of entry, often on a hand or arm. This initial lesion may ulcerate. Over weeks to months, new, similar nodules or ulcers may appear in a line along lymphatic vessels draining from the initial site ('sporotrichoid spread'). These secondary lesions are often painless or mildly tender. 2) Pulmonary sporotrichosis (rare): Occurs from inhaling spores, usually affecting people with underlying lung disease (e.g., COPD) or weakened immune systems. Can cause cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, weight loss, similar to tuberculosis. 3) Disseminated sporotrichosis (rare): Occurs when infection spreads from initial site (skin or lungs) to other parts of the body, such as bones, joints, muscles, central nervous system (meningitis), or other organs. This form is more common and severe in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop a non-healing skin lesion, especially a nodule or ulcer that spreads in a linear fashion, particularly after handling soil, plants, or moss, or after a skin injury, consult your doctor or dermatologist.

    "general_advice": "Sprain and strain are common terms for soft tissue injuries affecting ligaments, muscles, or tendons. 1) Sprain: An injury to a ligament, which is a tough, fibrous band of tissue that connects bones to each other at a joint, providing stability. A sprain occurs when a ligament is stretched or torn, often due to a sudden twisting, wrenching, or overextension of a joint. Common sites include ankles, knees, wrists. Sprains are graded by severity (Grade I - mild stretch, II - partial tear, III - complete tear). 2) Strain: An injury to a muscle or a tendon (fibrous cord connecting muscle to bone). A strain occurs when a muscle or tendon is overstretched or torn, often from overuse, forceful contraction, or sudden overexertion. Common sites include hamstrings, quadriceps, groin (adductors), calf, lower back, shoulder (rotator cuff). Strains are also graded by severity. Symptoms of both sprains and strains can include: pain, swelling, bruising, tenderness, limited range of motion, and sometimes muscle weakness or spasms, or joint instability (with sprains).",

Also, if there are vision changes or persistent, bothersome symptoms.",
    "general_advice": "Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), or blocked tear duct, is a condition where the tear drainage system for one or both eyes is partially or completely blocked, preventing tears from draining normally from the eye surface into the nasal cavity. Tears are produced by lacrimal glands, wash over the eye, and then drain through small openings (puncta) in the inner corners of the eyelids, into tiny canals (canaliculi), then into the lacrimal sac, and finally down the nasolacrimal duct into the nose. When this duct is blocked, tears can't drain properly and may overflow onto the cheek (epiphora - excessive tearing). This can also lead to stagnant tears in the lacrimal sac, increasing risk of infection (dacryocystitis). NLDO can be: 1) Congenital: Common in newborns, often due to a persistent membrane at the end of the nasolacrimal duct that fails to open at or shortly after birth. Most resolve spontaneously within the first year. 2) Acquired: Can occur in adults due to age-related narrowing of the duct, chronic nasal or sinus inflammation/infections, facial trauma or surgery, nasal polyps, tumors (rare), or certain medications. Symptoms include: excessive tearing or watery eyes, recurrent eye infections or inflammation (conjunctivitis, dacryocystitis), crusting of eyelashes, blurred vision (from excess tears), and sometimes a tender, swollen bump near the inner corner of the eye if lacrimal sac is infected/inflamed.",

Common triggers include coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting heavy objects, running, jumping, or exercising. It happens when the muscles and tissues supporting the bladder and urethra (pelvic floor muscles) and/or the urethral sphincter (muscle that controls urine flow) are weakened or damaged, preventing the urethra from closing completely when pressure is applied. SUI is very common, especially in women. Risk factors include: pregnancy and childbirth (vaginal delivery can stretch/damage pelvic floor), menopause (due to estrogen loss affecting tissue tone), obesity, chronic cough (e.g., from smoking or lung disease), chronic constipation or straining, previous pelvic surgery (e.g., hysterectomy, prostate surgery in men - though urge incontinence is more common after prostatectomy), high-impact sports, and genetic factors affecting connective tissue. SUI is different from urge incontinence (sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by leakage, often from overactive bladder) or overflow incontinence (leakage from an overly full bladder - see separate entries), though mixed incontinence (combination of stress and urge) is also common.",

    "general_advice": "An esophageal stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the esophagus, the muscular tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. This narrowing can make it difficult for food and sometimes liquids to pass through, leading to dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Benign (non-cancerous) esophageal strictures are most commonly caused by scarring and fibrosis resulting from chronic inflammation or injury to the esophageal lining. Common causes include: 1) Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Repeated exposure to stomach acid damages the esophagus, leading to inflammation (reflux esophagitis) and subsequent scarring/narrowing. This is the most frequent cause. 2) Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): An allergic inflammatory condition that can cause strictures. 3) Ingestion of caustic substances (e.g., strong acids or alkalis - accidental or intentional). 4) Radiation therapy to the chest or neck (for cancer). 5) Complications of esophageal surgery or procedures (e.g., after endoscopic resection of lesions). 6) Prolonged use of a nasogastric (NG) tube. 7) Rare skin diseases affecting esophagus (e.g., pemphigoid). Symptoms primarily include: dysphagia (often starting with solids, then progressing to liquids if severe), a sensation of food getting stuck in the chest, pain when swallowing (odynophagia), regurgitation of undigested food, heartburn, frequent coughing or choking when eating, and sometimes weight loss or nutritional deficiencies due to reduced food intake.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have difficulty swallowing or other symptoms suggestive of an esophageal stricture, consult your doctor (primary care or gastroenterologist). Diagnosis involves an upper GI endoscopy (to visualize the esophagus, assess the stricture, and take biopsies to rule out cancer or identify cause like EoE) and/or a barium swallow X-ray (esophagram - can show narrowing and its extent).",

Time is critical; prompt treatment can minimize brain damage and improve outcomes.",
    "general_advice": "A stroke, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, which causes brain cells to die within minutes. There are two main types of stroke: 1) Ischemic stroke (most common, about 85%): Caused by a blockage (occlusion) of an artery supplying blood to the brain. The blockage is usually due to a blood clot (thrombus) forming on an atherosclerotic plaque within a brain artery (thrombotic stroke), or an embolus (clot or debris) traveling from elsewhere in the body (e.g., heart - common with atrial fibrillation, or carotid arteries) and lodging in a brain artery (embolic stroke). 2) Hemorrhagic stroke: Caused by bleeding in or around the brain when a blood vessel ruptures. Includes intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding within brain tissue - see separate entry) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding in space around brain, often from ruptured aneurysm - see separate entry). A Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA or 'mini-stroke') is a temporary episode of stroke-like symptoms caused by a brief interruption of blood flow to the brain, usually lasting less than an hour and causing no permanent damage. However, TIAs are a major warning sign of future stroke risk and require urgent medical evaluation.",

Also, if styes are recurrent.",
    "general_advice": "A stye, also known as a hordeolum, is an acute, localized infection or inflammation of one or more of the small glands in the eyelid. It typically appears as a red, tender, painful, pimple-like bump at or near the edge of the eyelid. There are two types: 1) External hordeolum: An infection of an eyelash follicle or a gland of Zeis or Moll (sweat/oil glands associated with eyelash follicles). Appears as a small pustule at the eyelid margin, pointing outwards. 2) Internal hordeolum: An infection of a Meibomian gland (oil glands within the tarsal plate of the eyelid). Usually larger, more painful, and points inwards towards the conjunctiva, or can cause more diffuse eyelid swelling. Styes are most commonly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* (staph) bacteria. They are not usually contagious in the same way as conjunctivitis, but bacteria can be spread if hygiene is poor.

    "general_advice": "Subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis or granulomatous thyroiditis, is an inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland, thought to be caused by a viral infection or a post-viral inflammatory response. It often follows an upper respiratory tract infection. The inflammation causes thyroid cells to be damaged and release stored thyroid hormones into the bloodstream, leading to a temporary period of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). This is then often followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) as the gland recovers, and finally, a return to normal thyroid function (euthyroidism) in most individuals (usually within 12-18 months). The hallmark symptom is neck pain and tenderness, often localized over the thyroid gland (at base of neck), which can be severe and may radiate to the jaw or ears. The thyroid gland is often enlarged and tender to palpation. Other symptoms during the hyperthyroid phase can include: fever, fatigue, malaise, nervousness, anxiety, palpitations, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, and tremor. During the hypothyroid phase, symptoms can include fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, weight gain, and dry skin. Some people may experience only one phase or cycle through them.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience neck pain with tenderness over the thyroid, especially if accompanied by fever or symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, physical exam (tender, enlarged thyroid), and blood tests: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are usually very high (indicating inflammation). Thyroid function tests typically show low TSH and high free T4/T3 during hyperthyroid phase, then high TSH and low free T4/T3 during hypothyroid phase. Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) test shows very low uptake during hyperthyroid phase (as thyroid is inflamed and not actively producing new hormone, just leaking stored hormone).

Rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent re-bleeding and manage complications.",
    "general_advice": "A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which is the area between the brain and the thin membranes (meninges - specifically between arachnoid mater and pia mater) that cover the brain and spinal cord. This space normally contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The most common cause of spontaneous (non-traumatic) SAH is the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm, which is a weak, bulging spot on an artery in the brain. Other causes can include: arteriovenous malformation (AVM - a tangle of abnormal blood vessels) rupture, head trauma (traumatic SAH is common), bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use, or rarely, certain types of brain tumors or infections. The bleeding irritates the brain and meninges, increases intracranial pressure, and can lead to brain damage, stroke (from vasospasm - narrowing of brain arteries, a common complication after SAH), hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in brain), seizures, and death. Re-bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm is a major risk in the early period.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical care in a hospital with neurosurgical and stroke capabilities is essential. Diagnosis is made with a CT scan of the head (can usually detect SAH quickly). If CT is negative but SAH is still highly suspected, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be done to look for blood in the CSF.

    "emergency_advice": "While usually harmless, seek medical attention from an eye doctor if a subconjunctival hemorrhage: is associated with significant eye pain, vision changes (blurring, double vision), light sensitivity, or discharge; occurs after significant eye trauma or head injury (to rule out more serious internal eye injury or skull fracture); is very large or involves the entire white of the eye; is recurrent without obvious cause; or if you are on blood-thinning medication or have a bleeding disorder.",
    "general_advice": "A subconjunctival hemorrhage is a common, usually benign condition where a small blood vessel breaks just beneath the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye (sclera). This causes blood to leak out and spread under the conjunctiva, resulting in a bright red or dark red patch on the white of the eye. It often looks alarming but is typically painless and does not affect vision. It's similar to a bruise on the skin. Causes can include: spontaneous rupture of a tiny blood vessel (often no known cause), straining (from coughing, sneezing, vomiting, heavy lifting, or constipation), eye rubbing, minor eye trauma, high blood pressure (though not a direct cause, can be associated), or use of blood-thinning medications (e.g., aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Most subconjunctival hemorrhages do not require medical treatment. However, if you have concerns or meet any of the emergency criteria, see an eye doctor. They can confirm the diagnosis and rule out other problems.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "There is no specific treatment to speed up the resolution of a subconjunctival hemorrhage. The blood will gradually be reabsorbed by the body over 1-3 weeks, similar to a bruise. The red patch may change color (e.g., to yellowish or greenish) as it heals.",
      "Artificial tears (lubricating eye drops) may be used if there's mild irritation or a gritty sensation.",
      "Avoid rubbing your eyes.",
      "If caused by straining, try to address the underlying cause (e.g., manage constipation, control coughing).",
      "If you are on blood thinners, inform your doctor who prescribes them, but do NOT stop your medication unless advised to do so.",

Call emergency services (911, 999, 112) or go to the nearest emergency room immediately if someone experiences symptoms after a head injury (even a seemingly minor one, especially in elderly or those on blood thinners), or if symptoms develop gradually and suggest SDH. Symptoms can include: persistent or worsening headache, confusion, drowsiness, lethargy, personality changes, slurred speech, vision problems, dizziness, weakness or numbness on one side of body, seizures, or loss of consciousness. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical.",
    "general_advice": "A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a collection of blood that forms between the dura mater (the tough outer membrane covering the brain) and the arachnoid mater (the membrane beneath the dura). It's usually caused by tearing of bridging veins that cross the subdural space, often due to head trauma. SDHs are classified based on onset: 1) Acute SDH: Develops rapidly (within hours to a few days) after severe head injury. Associated with significant brain injury and high mortality. Symptoms are often immediate and severe. 2) Subacute SDH: Develops more slowly (days to 2-3 weeks) after head injury. Symptoms may be less dramatic initially. 3) Chronic SDH: Develops very gradually (weeks to months) after a minor or sometimes even unrecognized head injury. More common in elderly individuals (due to brain atrophy, which stretches bridging veins, making them more vulnerable) and those on anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications. Symptoms can be subtle and insidious (e.g., progressive headache, confusion, memory problems, unsteadiness, weakness, personality changes), often mimicking dementia or stroke. The accumulating blood can compress brain tissue and increase intracranial pressure, leading to brain damage.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical care is essential if an acute SDH is suspected, or if symptoms of chronic SDH develop. Diagnosis is made with a CT scan of the head (shows characteristic crescent-shaped hematoma) or MRI.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Self-care is NOT for managing an SDH. It requires urgent neurosurgical evaluation and treatment.",
      "Treatment depends on the size of the hematoma, severity of symptoms, whether it's acute or chronic, and patient's overall condition.",
      "  - For small, asymptomatic chronic SDHs: Careful observation with serial CT scans may be an option if stable.",
      "  - For symptomatic or larger acute/subacute/chronic SDHs: Surgical evacuation of the hematoma is usually necessary. This can be done via: burr holes (small holes drilled in skull to drain fluid blood), craniotomy (temporary removal of a bone flap to access and remove clot), or sometimes other techniques.",
      "  - Supportive care in hospital: Managing intracranial pressure, seizure prevention/treatment, neurological monitoring.",

    "general_advice": "A substance-induced mental disorder is a mental health condition (e.g., psychosis, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, delirium, sleep disorder, sexual dysfunction, neurocognitive disorder) where the symptoms are a direct physiological consequence of substance intoxication (current use), substance withdrawal (after stopping or reducing use), or medication use. The symptoms are typically more severe or persistent than the transient effects usually associated with intoxication or withdrawal for that substance, and cause clinically significant distress or impairment. Many different substances can induce mental disorders, including: Alcohol, Cannabis, Hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin), Inhalants, Opioids, Sedatives/Hypnotics/Anxiolytics (benzodiazepines, barbiturates), Stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine), Tobacco (withdrawal can cause irritability/anxiety/depression), Caffeine (intoxication/withdrawal can cause anxiety/sleep issues), and various prescription or over-the-counter medications (e.g., corticosteroids can induce mood changes/psychosis; some cold meds can cause agitation). The specific mental disorder induced depends on the substance and individual vulnerability. For example, stimulants can induce psychosis or anxiety; alcohol/sedative withdrawal can cause anxiety, delirium, or seizures; opioid withdrawal causes dysphoria/anxiety.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or someone you know is experiencing significant mental health symptoms that appear to be related to substance use or withdrawal, consult a doctor or mental health professional (psychiatrist, addiction specialist, therapist). It's crucial to get an accurate diagnosis, differentiate from a primary mental disorder, and address both the substance use and the mental health symptoms.",

Severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema and is life-threatening.",
    "general_advice": "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition characterized by the excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary gland (or from an abnormal source elsewhere in the body), or an increased kidney response to ADH, leading to impaired water excretion by the kidneys. ADH normally tells the kidneys to reabsorb water, concentrating urine and conserving body water. In SIADH, too much ADH causes the kidneys to reabsorb too much water, leading to water retention, dilution of body fluids, and a low blood sodium level (dilutional hyponatremia - see Hyponatremia entry). Urine is often inappropriately concentrated despite the low blood sodium. Causes of SIADH are numerous and can include: 1) Cancers (especially small cell lung cancer, which can produce ectopic ADH). 2) Central nervous system disorders (e.g., stroke, head trauma, brain tumors, infections like meningitis/encephalitis, hydrocephalus). 3) Lung diseases (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis, COPD, asthma). 4) Medications (many drugs can stimulate ADH release or enhance its action, e.g., certain antidepressants like SSRIs/TCAs, carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, opioids, NSAIDs, ecstasy). 5) Major surgery or severe pain/stress. 6) Idiopathic (unknown cause). Symptoms are primarily those of hyponatremia and depend on severity and rapidity of onset. Mild, chronic hyponatremia may be asymptomatic or cause subtle symptoms. More significant or acute hyponatremia causes nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, and can progress to seizures, coma (see emergency advice).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of hyponatremia or a condition known to be associated with SIADH, consult your doctor. Diagnosis of SIADH involves confirming hyponatremia (low serum sodium) with low serum osmolality, inappropriately concentrated urine (high urine osmolality relative to serum), normal kidney/adrenal/thyroid function, and euvolemia (normal body fluid volume status, or mild hypervolemia without edema). The underlying cause needs to be identified.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management is medically supervised and focuses on treating the underlying cause of SIADH (if possible) and correcting the hyponatremia slowly and carefully.",
      "  - Fluid restriction: Often the first-line treatment, limiting daily fluid intake (e.g., to 800-1000 mL/day) to help increase serum sodium.",

      "  - Medications (for more severe or persistent hyponatremia, or if fluid restriction is not effective/tolerated):",
      "    - Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) may be used with salt tablets to increase free water excretion.",
      "    - Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans - e.g., tolvaptan, conivaptan): Block the action of ADH on kidneys, promoting water excretion. Used cautiously, often in hospital setting, due to risk of too rapid correction or liver issues.",
      "    - Demeclocycline (an antibiotic that can inhibit ADH effect - less used now).",
      "  - For severe, symptomatic hyponatremia: Careful infusion of hypertonic saline (3% saline) in a hospital setting with frequent monitoring of sodium levels to correct it slowly (rapid correction can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome - a serious neurological complication).",

Gummas (late benign syphilis lesions) causing critical organ damage also need urgent care. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial at all stages to prevent irreversible damage.",
    "general_advice": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum*. It progresses in stages if left untreated, and can affect many parts of the body. 1) Primary syphilis (3-90 days after exposure, average 21 days): Characterized by a chancre, which is usually a single, firm, painless, round sore or ulcer at the site of infection (genitals, anus, mouth, or lips). Chancre often heals on its own within 3-6 weeks, even without treatment, but infection persists. 2) Secondary syphilis (weeks to months after chancre heals, if untreated): Bacteria spread throughout body. Symptoms include a non-itchy skin rash (often on palms/soles, can be widespread), mucous membrane lesions (sores in mouth, vagina, anus), swollen lymph nodes, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, weight loss, and patchy hair loss. Symptoms also resolve without treatment, but infection continues. 3) Latent syphilis: After secondary stage symptoms disappear, syphilis enters a latent (hidden) stage where there are no symptoms, but infection is still present. Can last for years. Early latent (<1 year), late latent (>1 year). 4) Tertiary (late) syphilis (10-30 years after initial infection, if untreated, in about 15-40% of untreated): Can cause severe damage to heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular syphilis - e.g., aortitis, aortic aneurysm), brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis - e.g., meningitis, stroke, dementia/general paresis, tabes dorsalis - spinal cord degeneration), skin and bones (gummas - soft, tumor-like growths). Congenital syphilis occurs when a pregnant woman transmits syphilis to her fetus, which can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or severe health problems in the newborn. Syphilis is transmitted by direct contact with a chancre during sexual activity (vaginal, anal, oral) or from mother to baby during pregnancy/childbirth.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have any sores, rash, or other symptoms suggestive of syphilis, or if you've had unprotected sex or a partner diagnosed with syphilis, get tested. Regular STI screening is important for sexually active individuals. Diagnosis involves blood tests (for antibodies - non-treponemal tests like VDRL/RPR for screening/monitoring, and treponemal tests like TP-PA/FTA-ABS for confirmation). Direct detection of bacteria from chancre fluid (dark-field microscopy or PCR) can also be done. Neurosyphilis diagnosis may involve lumbar puncture. Syphilis is treatable and curable with antibiotics, especially in early stages.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If diagnosed with syphilis, take all prescribed antibiotics exactly as directed by your doctor. Penicillin (usually injectable penicillin G) is the preferred treatment for all stages. Dosage and duration depend on stage. For penicillin-allergic individuals, alternative antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, tetracycline, ceftriaxone) may be used, but penicillin desensitization may be needed for neurosyphilis or syphilis in pregnancy.",
      "Abstain from all sexual activity until you and all your sexual partner(s) have completed treatment and are cleared by a doctor.",
      "Notify all sexual partners (from recent past - duration depends on stage of your syphilis) so they can be tested and treated. This is crucial to prevent reinfection and further spread.",
      "Follow-up blood tests are necessary after treatment to ensure the infection has been cured (VDRL/RPR titers should decline).",
      "Practice safe sex consistently (condoms) to reduce STI risk.",

    "general_advice": "Syringomyelia is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cyst or cavity (called a syrinx) within the spinal cord. Over time, this syrinx can expand and elongate, compressing or damaging nerve fibers in the spinal cord that transmit signals between the brain and the body. This can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms, depending on the location and size of the syrinx. Most commonly, syringomyelia is associated with a Chiari I malformation, a condition where brain tissue (cerebellar tonsils) protrudes into the spinal canal, obstructing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. Other causes can include: spinal cord trauma or injury, spinal cord tumors, meningitis or arachnoiditis (inflammation of membranes around spinal cord), tethered spinal cord syndrome, or idiopathic (unknown cause). Symptoms often develop gradually and may include: pain (often in neck, shoulders, arms, or back, can be burning, aching, or sharp), weakness and muscle atrophy (wasting) in arms and hands (often asymmetrical), stiffness in back, shoulders, arms, or legs, loss of sensation (especially to pain and temperature, often in a 'cape-like' distribution over shoulders/arms, while touch sensation may be preserved - 'dissociated sensory loss'), headaches, scoliosis (curvature of spine), and sometimes bowel/bladder dysfunction or problems with sweating or temperature regulation.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent, unexplained pain, weakness, numbness, or other neurological symptoms suggestive of syringomyelia, consult your doctor (primary care or neurologist/neurosurgeon). Diagnosis is made with an MRI of the spine (and often brain, to look for Chiari malformation or other causes), which can visualize the syrinx.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends on the underlying cause, size of syrinx, severity of symptoms, and rate of progression. It's guided by a neurosurgeon and neurologist.",
      "  - Observation: If syrinx is small and asymptomatic or causing only mild, stable symptoms, regular MRI monitoring may be all that's needed.",
      "  - Treatment of underlying cause: If a Chiari malformation is present and thought to be causing the syrinx, surgical decompression of the Chiari (posterior fossa decompression) may be performed to restore normal CSF flow and potentially allow the syrinx to shrink or stabilize. If a tumor is the cause, removing the tumor may help.",
      "  - Surgical drainage or shunting of the syrinx: If the syrinx is large, progressive, or causing significant symptoms, and the underlying cause can't be effectively treated or if it persists after treating cause, surgery may be done to drain the syrinx directly (e.g., by creating a small opening - syringostomy, or by placing a shunt tube to divert fluid from syrinx to another body cavity like peritoneal or pleural space).",
      "  - Pain management: Medications for neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline), NSAIDs, or other analgesics.",
      "  - Physical and occupational therapy: To maintain/improve strength, range of motion, function, and help with adaptive strategies for daily living if there are neurological deficits.",
      "  - Avoid activities that can increase pressure in the syrinx or spinal cord (e.g., heavy straining, activities with risk of spinal trauma - discuss with doctor).",

    "general_advice": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), commonly known as lupus, is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues and organs. This can cause widespread inflammation and damage in various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, blood cells, and blood vessels. Lupus is characterized by periods of illness (flares) and periods of remission (when symptoms are less active). The cause is unknown but involves genetic predisposition, hormonal factors (more common in women, especially of childbearing age), and environmental triggers (e.g., sun exposure, infections, certain medications - drug-induced lupus). Symptoms are highly variable and can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on which body systems are affected. Common symptoms include: extreme fatigue, joint pain, stiffness, and swelling (arthritis), a characteristic butterfly-shaped rash (malar rash) across the cheeks and nose (though not everyone gets it), skin rashes that worsen with sun exposure (photosensitivity), fever, unexplained weight loss or gain, mouth sores (ulcers), hair loss (alopecia), Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers/toes turn white/blue and feel numb in cold/stress), chest pain (pleurisy or pericarditis), headaches, confusion, memory problems, and kidney problems (lupus nephritis - often no early symptoms, detected by urine/blood tests). Blood abnormalities (anemia, low white cells, low platelets) are also common.",

Temporary or benign causes of hematuria can occur, meaning it's not due to a serious, progressive disease, and may resolve on its own or with minimal intervention. Potential benign/transient causes include: 1) Strenuous exercise: Can sometimes cause temporary hematuria, especially in runners ('marathonuria'). 2) Minor trauma or irritation to urinary tract. 3) Menstruation: Contamination of urine sample with menstrual blood in women. 4) Certain medications: e.g., some antibiotics (rifampin can turn urine orange-red, not true hematuria; cyclophosphamide can cause hemorrhagic cystitis), or anticoagulants (can unmask underlying minor bleeding). 5) Benign familial hematuria: An inherited condition causing persistent microscopic hematuria but usually no serious kidney problems. 6) Loin pain hematuria syndrome: Rare, causes flank pain and hematuria, cause unclear. 7) Sometimes a single episode of microscopic hematuria may have no identifiable cause and not recur. However, it's crucial to distinguish these from more serious causes like UTIs, kidney stones, kidney diseases (glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease), bladder/kidney/prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), trauma, or bleeding disorders.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "All episodes of gross hematuria, and persistent or significant microscopic hematuria, require medical evaluation by a doctor (primary care, urologist, or nephrologist) to determine the cause. Diagnosis involves a urinalysis, urine culture (if infection suspected), blood tests (kidney function, CBC, clotting studies if needed), imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI), and often cystoscopy (looking inside bladder with a scope) or ureteroscopy.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends entirely on the underlying cause, if one is identified.",
      "  - If due to strenuous exercise, it usually resolves with rest and hydration. Discuss with doctor if recurrent.",

    "general_advice": "Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), often referred to as TMJ disorders or TMJ syndrome (TMJ actually refers to the joint itself), are a group of conditions that cause pain and dysfunction in the temporomandibular joints (the two joints connecting the lower jaw/mandible to the skull, located in front of each ear) and the muscles and ligaments that control jaw movement. Symptoms can vary widely and may include: pain or tenderness in the jaw joint area, face, neck, or shoulders (often worse with chewing, talking, or yawning); clicking, popping, or grating sounds (crepitus) in the jaw joint when opening or closing the mouth; difficulty opening or closing the mouth fully; locking of the jaw (getting 'stuck' open or closed); headaches (often tension-type); earaches or ringing in ears (tinnitus); dizziness; and sometimes changes in how upper and lower teeth fit together (malocclusion). The exact cause of TMD is often multifactorial and not always clear, but can involve: problems with the jaw muscles (myofascial pain), issues within the joint itself (e.g., disc displacement/derangement, arthritis - osteoarthritis/rheumatoid arthritis), trauma or injury to the jaw or TMJ, teeth grinding or clenching (bruxism - often stress-related or during sleep), stress, or dental problems affecting bite.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent jaw pain, clicking, locking, or difficulty with jaw function, consult your doctor or dentist. They can evaluate your symptoms, examine your jaw, and may refer you to a specialist (e.g., TMJ specialist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or physical therapist specializing in TMD). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical exam and history. Imaging (X-rays, panoramic X-ray, CT, MRI) may be used in some cases to assess joint structure or rule out other conditions.",

    "emergency_advice": "While tendinitis is not usually an emergency, seek immediate medical attention if you experience: sudden, severe pain with inability to move the affected joint or limb, or a 'pop' or 'snap' sound at the time of injury, as this could indicate a complete tendon rupture (which may require urgent surgical repair). Also, if there are signs of infection around the tendon area (redness, warmth, swelling, fever).",
    "general_advice": "Tendinitis (also spelled tendonitis) is the inflammation of a tendon, which is a thick, fibrous cord that attaches muscle to bone. The term tendinopathy is often preferred now as many chronic tendon problems involve degeneration (tendinosis) with or without significant inflammation. Tendinitis/tendinopathy is usually caused by overuse, repetitive strain, or sudden injury to a tendon, leading to microtears, inflammation, and pain. It can occur in many parts of the body. Common types include: Rotator cuff tendinitis (shoulder - see separate entry), Biceps tendinitis (shoulder/upper arm), Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis - outer elbow, see separate entry), Golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis - inner elbow), Patellar tendinitis ('jumper's knee' - below kneecap), Achilles tendinitis (back of heel/ankle), De Quervain's tenosynovitis (thumb side of wrist - see separate entry), and Wrist tendinitis. Symptoms typically include: pain or aching at the site of the affected tendon, often worse with movement or activity involving that tendon; tenderness to touch over the tendon; mild swelling or thickening of the tendon; and sometimes stiffness or reduced range of motion. Risk factors include age (tendons become less flexible), certain sports or occupations involving repetitive motions, improper technique or equipment, sudden increases in activity level, and some medical conditions (e.g., arthritis, diabetes).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If tendon pain is severe, persistent (lasts more than a few weeks despite self-care), or significantly limits your activity, consult your doctor (primary care, sports medicine, or orthopedist). They can diagnose the condition (usually by physical exam, sometimes with ultrasound or MRI if tear or other issues suspected) and recommend appropriate treatment.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Conservative treatment is usually effective.",
      "  - Rest and activity modification: Avoid or reduce activities that cause pain or stress the affected tendon. This is crucial for healing.",
      "  - Ice: Apply cold packs for 15-20 minutes, several times a day, especially after activity or during acute pain, to reduce inflammation.",
      "  - Pain relievers: Over-the-counter NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) or acetaminophen. Topical NSAID gels/creams can also be helpful.",
      "  - Compression: An elastic wrap or supportive brace/strap may help reduce stress on the tendon and provide support (e.g., tennis elbow strap, wrist splint, ankle brace).",
      "  - Gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises: Once acute pain subsides, to prevent stiffness.",
      "  - Eccentric strengthening exercises: Specific exercises where the muscle lengthens under tension (e.g., for Achilles or patellar tendinopathy) are often very effective for tendinopathy. A physical therapist can design a specific program.",
      "  - Gradual return to activity: Avoid returning too quickly or too intensely to prevent re-injury.",
      "  - Proper technique and ergonomics for sports/work activities. Ensure proper equipment.",
      "Medical treatments (if conservative measures fail):",
      "  - Physical therapy: For specific exercise programs, manual therapy, and modalities.",
      "  - Corticosteroid injections near the tendon (used cautiously, as can sometimes weaken tendon if injected directly into it, especially for weight-bearing tendons like Achilles).",
      "  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections or other regenerative medicine techniques (evidence still evolving).",

    "general_advice": "Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of primary headache (meaning not caused by an underlying medical condition). It's often described as a constant, dull ache or pressure, typically on both sides of the head (bilateral), often feeling like a tight band or vise around the head. The pain is usually mild to moderate in intensity and is generally not aggravated by routine physical activity (unlike migraine). Nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light (photophobia) or sound (phonophobia) are usually absent or mild if present (if prominent, consider migraine). TTH can be: 1) Episodic: Occurs less than 15 days per month. Can be infrequent (e.g., a few times a year) or frequent. 2) Chronic: Occurs 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months. Can be very disabling. The exact cause is not fully understood but may involve muscle tension in the neck, scalp, and shoulders, as well as changes in brain chemicals (like serotonin) and pain sensitivity. Common triggers include: stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, poor posture (e.g., from prolonged computer use, 'text neck'), eye strain, hunger (skipping meals), dehydration, changes in sleep patterns, caffeine withdrawal, jaw clenching or teeth grinding (bruxism), and sometimes weather changes or certain smells.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have frequent or severe headaches, if they interfere with your daily life, if your headache pattern changes, or if you are concerned, consult your doctor. They can diagnose TTH based on your symptoms and headache history, and rule out other causes. Keeping a headache diary can be helpful. It's important to differentiate TTH from migraine or other headache types for appropriate management.",
    "self_care_tips": [

Any new, unexplained testicular lump or significant change should be evaluated promptly.",
    "general_advice": "Testicular cancer is cancer that develops in one or both testicles (testes), the male reproductive glands located inside the scrotum that produce sperm and testosterone. It's a relatively rare cancer overall, but it's the most common cancer in young men (typically ages 15-35, though can occur at any age). There are two main types of testicular cancer, based on the type of cell where they originate: 1) Germ cell tumors (GCTs - >90% of cases): Arise from germ cells (cells that produce sperm). Subtypes include seminomas (tend to be slower growing, more sensitive to radiation) and non-seminomas (e.g., embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, teratoma - often grow more quickly and may be mixed). 2) Stromal tumors (rare): Arise from hormone-producing or supportive tissues of testes (e.g., Leydig cell tumors, Sertoli cell tumors). The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a painless lump or swelling in one testicle. Other symptoms can include: a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, a dull ache or pain in the testicle, scrotum, groin, or lower abdomen, a change in the size or consistency of a testicle, or sometimes fluid collection in scrotum (hydrocele). In some cases, symptoms of metastatic disease may be the first sign (e.g., low back pain from retroperitoneal lymph node mets, cough/shortness of breath from lung mets, breast tenderness/enlargement - gynecomastia, due to hormone production by some tumors). Risk factors include: undescended testicle (cryptorchidism - even if surgically corrected), family history of testicular cancer, personal history of testicular cancer in other testicle, certain genetic conditions (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome), and possibly HIV infection. Testicular cancer is highly treatable and often curable, especially when detected and treated early.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice any lump, swelling, pain, or other change in your testicles, consult your doctor (primary care or urologist) promptly. Don't delay. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, testicular ultrasound (key imaging test), blood tests for tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein - AFP, human chorionic gonadotropin - hCG, lactate dehydrogenase - LDH), and if cancer is suspected, surgical removal of the entire affected testicle (radical inguinal orchiectomy) is usually done for both diagnosis (pathology of tumor) and primary treatment. A biopsy of the testicle before removal is generally NOT done due to risk of spreading cancer cells.",

      "    - Chemotherapy: Often used for non-seminomas if spread to lymph nodes or distant sites, or as adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage I. Also used for advanced seminomas. Common regimens include BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin).",
      "    - Radiation therapy: Primarily used for seminomas, often to retroperitoneal lymph nodes if spread there, or sometimes as adjuvant therapy for stage I seminoma.",
      "    - Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND): A major surgery to remove lymph nodes in back of abdomen where testicular cancer often spreads, may be done for non-seminomas (especially if lymph nodes are enlarged or if chemo doesn't eliminate them).",

Go to the nearest emergency department immediately if you or your child experiences: sudden onset of severe testicular pain (often unilateral), swelling of the scrotum, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or one testicle appearing higher than the other or at an unusual angle. Time is critical; permanent damage to the testicle can occur within hours (typically 4-12 hours) if blood flow is not restored.",
    "general_advice": "Testicular torsion occurs when a testicle rotates, twisting the spermatic cord that brings blood to the scrotum. This cuts off blood supply to the testicle, leading to ischemia (lack of oxygen) and potentially infarction (tissue death) if not corrected quickly. It can occur at any age but is most common in adolescent males (ages 12-18) and newborns. It can happen spontaneously (even during sleep), after minor trauma, or during physical activity. Some individuals may have an anatomical predisposition (e.g., 'bell clapper' deformity, where testicle is not well-anchored within scrotum). Symptoms include sudden, severe pain in one testicle (can sometimes be intermittent if torsion twists and untwists), swelling and redness of the scrotum, nausea and vomiting (common), abdominal pain, one testicle may appear higher than the other, and the cremasteric reflex (stroking inner thigh causes testicle to rise) is often absent on the affected side.",

    "general_advice": "A thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a bulge or weakened area in the wall of the aorta (the body's main artery) where it passes through the chest (thorax). The aorta carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. An aneurysm can cause the aortic wall to dilate (widen) and become prone to rupture (bursting, leading to massive internal bleeding) or dissection (a tear in the inner layer of the aortic wall, allowing blood to flow between layers, which can also be catastrophic). TAAs are less common than abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Risk factors include: atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries - common cause), genetic conditions affecting connective tissue (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome), bicuspid aortic valve (a congenital heart defect), family history of aortic aneurysms, long-term high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking, trauma to chest, or certain infections/inflammatory conditions affecting aorta (rare). Most TAAs are asymptomatic and grow slowly, often found incidentally on imaging done for other reasons. When symptoms do occur (usually as aneurysm enlarges or presses on nearby structures), they can include: chest pain or tenderness, back pain, cough, hoarseness (due to pressure on laryngeal nerve), shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have risk factors for TAA or experience concerning symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care, cardiologist, or cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon).

Symptoms include pain (often aching, burning) in neck, shoulder, arm, hand; numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in arm/fingers (often ulnar distribution - 4th/5th fingers); weakness or fatigue in arm/hand; and sometimes headaches (occipital). 2) Venous TOS (VTOS, Paget-Schroetter syndrome): Compression or clotting of the subclavian vein. Symptoms include arm swelling, pain, bluish discoloration (cyanosis) of arm/hand, and prominent veins on chest/shoulder. 3) Arterial TOS (ATOS - rarest but most serious): Compression or clotting of the subclavian artery. Symptoms include pain, coldness, paleness, numbness, tingling, weakness in arm/hand; diminished or absent pulse in wrist; and sometimes ischemic changes like finger ulcers or gangrene (rare). Causes of TOS can include: anatomical abnormalities (e.g., extra cervical rib, abnormal muscle or ligament attachments), trauma (e.g., whiplash, clavicle fracture), repetitive overhead arm movements or poor posture (e.g., from sports, occupations), obesity, or pregnancy.",

    "emergency_advice": "While a threatened miscarriage means the pregnancy is still ongoing, seek immediate medical attention if vaginal bleeding becomes very heavy (soaking through more than one pad per hour), if you pass large clots or tissue, if you have severe abdominal or pelvic pain/cramping, or if you develop fever, chills, or foul-smelling vaginal discharge (signs of infection). These could indicate progression to an inevitable or incomplete miscarriage, or another complication.",
    "general_advice": "A threatened miscarriage (or threatened abortion, an older medical term) is a condition that occurs in early pregnancy (usually before 20 weeks gestation) characterized by vaginal bleeding or spotting, sometimes accompanied by mild abdominal cramping or low back pain, but where the cervix remains closed and an ultrasound confirms that the fetus is still alive and viable within the uterus (i.e., a heartbeat is present). It indicates that there is a risk of miscarriage, but the pregnancy may still continue to term successfully. Many women who experience a threatened miscarriage go on to have a healthy pregnancy. The exact cause of the bleeding is often unknown, but can sometimes be related to implantation bleeding, cervical irritation, subchorionic hematoma (blood clot between uterine wall and chorionic membrane), or other factors. It's important to differentiate it from other types of miscarriage (inevitable, incomplete, complete) or ectopic pregnancy.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy should be reported to your doctor or obstetric provider immediately. They will perform an evaluation, including a pelvic exam (to check cervix), ultrasound (to confirm fetal viability and location of pregnancy, and look for cause of bleeding), and possibly hCG blood tests (to monitor pregnancy hormone levels).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management is guided by your obstetric provider and focuses on monitoring and supportive care.",
      "  - Pelvic rest: Your doctor will likely recommend avoiding sexual intercourse, douching, and tampons while bleeding persists.",

A very low platelet count (e.g., <10,000-20,000/µL) carries a high risk of spontaneous, life-threatening bleeding.",
    "general_advice": "Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by a lower-than-normal number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood. Platelets are small blood cells produced in the bone marrow that are essential for blood clotting (hemostasis). A low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Normal platelet count is typically 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter (µL) of blood. Thrombocytopenia can be mild (often asymptomatic) to severe. Causes are diverse and can be grouped into: 1) Decreased platelet production by bone marrow: e.g., due to leukemia or other bone marrow cancers, aplastic anemia, viral infections (HIV, hepatitis C, parvovirus), vitamin B12/folate deficiency, chemotherapy or radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, or certain medications. 2) Increased platelet destruction or consumption: e.g., Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP - autoimmune disorder where immune system destroys platelets), drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) or Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS - rare, serious clotting disorders that consume platelets), Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), infections (sepsis, viral infections), or hypersplenism (enlarged spleen traps/destroys platelets). 3) Dilutional thrombocytopenia: From massive blood transfusions. Symptoms depend on severity. Mild cases may have no symptoms. As platelet count drops, symptoms can include: easy or excessive bruising, petechiae (superficial bleeding into skin, appear as tiny red/purple dots, often on lower legs), purpura (larger areas of bruising), prolonged bleeding from cuts, bleeding from gums or nose, blood in urine or stools, heavy menstrual bleeding, and fatigue. Severe thrombocytopenia can lead to spontaneous, life-threatening internal bleeding.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience unexplained or excessive bruising or bleeding, or other symptoms of thrombocytopenia, consult your doctor (primary care or hematologist). Thrombocytopenia is diagnosed with a complete blood count (CBC).

It can affect: 1) Superficial veins (Superficial Thrombophlebitis - ST or SVT): Inflammation and clotting in a vein near the skin surface. Often occurs in varicose veins, after IV catheterization or infusion of irritating solutions, or due to trauma. Symptoms include: pain, tenderness, redness, warmth, and a palpable, firm, cord-like induration (hardness) along the course of the affected superficial vein. Usually localized and less serious than DVT, but can sometimes extend into or be associated with DVT. 2) Deep veins (Deep Vein Thrombosis - DVT - see separate entry): Clot formation in a deeper, larger vein. More serious due to risk of PE. (Note: sometimes 'thrombophlebitis' is used loosely to include DVT, but often it implies superficial involvement unless specified). Migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau's syndrome - recurrent ST in different locations) can be a sign of underlying cancer (especially pancreatic).",

Also, if there are signs of aggressive metastatic disease causing acute complications.",
    "general_advice": "Thyroid cancer is cancer that begins in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, below the Adam's apple, which produces hormones that regulate metabolism. There are several types of thyroid cancer: 1) Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC - most common, about 80%): Usually slow-growing, often spreads to lymph nodes in neck, generally has excellent prognosis if detected early. 2) Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC - about 10-15%): Also usually slow-growing, more likely to spread through bloodstream to distant sites (e.g., lungs, bones) than PTC. Prognosis generally good. Hürthle cell cancer is a subtype. 3) Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC - about 3-5%): Arises from C-cells of thyroid (which produce calcitonin). Can be sporadic or inherited (part of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia - MEN type 2 syndromes). Can spread to lymph nodes and distant sites. Prognosis varies. 4) Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC - rare, <2%): Very aggressive, fast-growing, often invades nearby structures, difficult to treat, poor prognosis. 5) Thyroid lymphoma (rare): Lymphoma that starts in thyroid gland. Symptoms of thyroid cancer can include: a lump or nodule in the neck (most common sign, often painless), swelling in the neck, pain in the front of the neck (sometimes radiating to ears), hoarseness or voice changes that persist, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), a persistent cough (not due to cold), or enlarged lymph nodes in neck. Many thyroid cancers, especially early papillary, are asymptomatic and may be found incidentally on imaging or during routine neck exam.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a lump, nodule, or swelling in your neck, or experience persistent voice changes, difficulty swallowing/breathing, or other concerning symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist/ENT surgeon). Diagnosis involves a physical exam, thyroid ultrasound (to characterize nodule), thyroid function tests (usually normal in thyroid cancer), and often a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the thyroid nodule (to examine cells for cancer). Sometimes a diagnostic surgical biopsy or removal of a lobe (lobectomy) is needed.",

      "  - Surgery: Mainstay of treatment for most thyroid cancers. May involve thyroid lobectomy (removal of one lobe) for small, low-risk cancers, or total thyroidectomy (removal of entire thyroid gland). Lymph node dissection in neck may also be done if cancer has spread to lymph nodes.",
      "  - Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy: Often given after total thyroidectomy for papillary or follicular thyroid cancer (differentiated thyroid cancer - DTC) to destroy any remaining thyroid tissue and microscopic cancer cells, and to treat metastases that take up iodine. Requires temporary thyroid hormone withdrawal or use of recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) to make cells receptive.",
      "  - Thyroid hormone suppression therapy: After thyroidectomy (total or near-total), lifelong thyroid hormone replacement (levothyroxine) is needed. The dose is often kept high enough to suppress TSH levels, which can help prevent recurrence of some DTCs.",
      "  - External beam radiation therapy (EBRT): May be used for some advanced, unresectable, or recurrent cancers, or for MTC or anaplastic cancer.",
      "  - Chemotherapy: Limited role for most DTCs, but may be used for advanced, metastatic, or anaplastic thyroid cancer.",
      "  - Targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors - TKIs like sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, cabozantinib): Options for some advanced or metastatic thyroid cancers (especially MTC or RAI-refractory DTC) with specific genetic mutations.",
      "Regular long-term follow-up is crucial after treatment, involving blood tests (thyroglobulin - Tg, and anti-Tg antibodies for DTC; calcitonin and CEA for MTC; TSH), neck ultrasound, and sometimes other imaging (RAI scans, CT, PET) to monitor for recurrence.",

    "general_advice": "Thyroid disease is a broad term for any condition affecting the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland in the neck that produces thyroid hormones (T3 - triiodothyronine, and T4 - thyroxine). These hormones regulate metabolism, affecting heart rate, body temperature, energy levels, weight, mood, and many other bodily functions. Thyroid disorders can involve: 1) Abnormal hormone production: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid - too little hormone), Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid - too much hormone). 2) Structural abnormalities: Goiter (enlarged thyroid gland - see separate entry), Thyroid nodules (lumps in thyroid - see separate entry), Thyroid cancer. 3) Inflammation: Thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto's - autoimmune, causing hypothyroidism; Subacute thyroiditis - often post-viral, causing transient hyper- then hypothyroidism; Postpartum thyroiditis; Drug-induced thyroiditis). Symptoms are highly variable depending on the specific disorder. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin/hair, depression, brain fog. Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, rapid/irregular heartbeat, anxiety, tremors, heat intolerance, sweating, diarrhea, goiter, eye changes (in Graves' disease). Thyroid nodules/goiter may be asymptomatic or cause neck swelling or compressive symptoms.",

    "general_advice": "A thyroid nodule is a discrete lump or growth that forms within the thyroid gland in the neck. Thyroid nodules are very common, especially as people age and with increased use of imaging. The vast majority (over 90-95%) of thyroid nodules are benign (non-cancerous) and cause no symptoms. They can be solid or fluid-filled (cysts). Nodules may be solitary or multiple (multinodular goiter - see Goiter entry). Most are discovered incidentally during a routine physical exam (palpation of neck) or on imaging tests (ultrasound, CT, MRI) done for other reasons. Sometimes, a nodule can be large enough to be visible as a lump in the neck, or cause compressive symptoms like difficulty swallowing, a feeling of pressure in the neck, or hoarseness (if pressing on recurrent laryngeal nerve). Rarely, a thyroid nodule can be 'hot' (autonomously functioning), meaning it produces excess thyroid hormone independently of TSH regulation, leading to hyperthyroidism (symptoms like weight loss, rapid heart rate, anxiety - this is less common). The main concern with a thyroid nodule is to rule out thyroid cancer, which occurs in a small percentage of nodules.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your doctor discovers a thyroid nodule, further evaluation by a doctor (primary care or endocrinologist/ENT surgeon) is needed. Diagnosis involves: 1) Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) to check if thyroid is over or underactive. 2) Thyroid ultrasound: Key imaging test to assess nodule size, number, and characteristics (e.g., solid vs. cystic, irregular margins, microcalcifications, increased blood flow - certain features can raise suspicion for malignancy). 3) Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy: If a nodule meets certain criteria (e.g., size >1-1.5 cm, suspicious ultrasound features, or history of radiation/family history of thyroid cancer), an FNA biopsy is usually performed (under ultrasound guidance) to collect cells from the nodule for cytological examination to determine if it's benign, malignant, suspicious, or indeterminate. 4) Radioactive iodine scan (thyroid scan): May be done if TSH is low (hyperthyroidism) to see if nodule is 'hot' (overactive, usually benign) or 'cold' (underactive, higher cancer risk than hot, though still mostly benign).",

If co-occurring conditions like severe anxiety, depression, or OCD lead to suicidal thoughts, seek immediate help.",
    "general_advice": "Tic disorders are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by tics, which are sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic motor movements or vocalizations (sounds). Tics are often preceded by an uncomfortable premonitory urge or sensation that is temporarily relieved by performing the tic. They are usually involuntary but can sometimes be suppressed for short periods with effort. Tics typically wax and wane in frequency, intensity, type, and location over time, and can be exacerbated by stress, excitement, fatigue, or anxiety. Types of tic disorders (as per DSM-5): 1) Tourette Syndrome (TS): Presence of multiple motor tics AND at least one vocal tic, occurring for more than 1 year, with onset before age 18. 2) Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder: Either motor tics OR vocal tics (but not both) present for more than 1 year, onset before 18. 3) Provisional Tic Disorder: Single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics present for less than 1 year, onset before 18. Motor tics can be simple (e.g., eye blinking, nose twitching, head jerking, shoulder shrugging) or complex (e.g., facial grimacing, touching, jumping, smelling objects, sometimes self-injurious tics like hitting oneself). Vocal tics can be simple (e.g., throat clearing, sniffing, grunting, barking, coughing) or complex (e.g., repeating words/phrases out of context - echolalia/palilalia, or rarely, uttering socially inappropriate words/obscenities - coprolalia). The exact cause of tic disorders is unknown but involves genetic and neurobiological factors (dysfunction in brain circuits involving basal ganglia, thalamus, cortex, and neurotransmitters like dopamine). Tic disorders often co-occur with other conditions like ADHD, OCD, anxiety disorders, or learning disabilities.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops tics that are persistent, bothersome, causing distress, interfering with daily activities, school, or social interactions, or if you have concerns, consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist, or psychiatrist/psychologist specializing in tic disorders).

The pain in Tietze syndrome is often localized, can be sharp or aching, and is typically worsened by deep breathing, coughing, sneezing, twisting motions, or pressure on the affected area. It usually affects only one side. The exact cause is unknown, but it may be related to minor trauma or strain to the chest wall, viral respiratory infections, or repeated coughing. It's more common in young adults (under 40).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent, localized chest wall pain with swelling, consult your doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and rule out other, more serious causes of chest pain (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, or other musculoskeletal issues). Diagnosis of Tietze syndrome is usually clinical, based on history and physical exam (localized tenderness and palpable swelling). Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI) may be done to exclude other conditions if diagnosis is uncertain, but often shows normal findings or just soft tissue swelling in Tietze.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Tietze syndrome is usually self-limiting and resolves on its own over several weeks to months, though can sometimes be persistent or recurrent.",
      "  - Rest and activity modification: Avoid activities that worsen the pain (e.g., strenuous exercise, heavy lifting, activities that put stress on chest wall).",
      "  - Pain relievers: Over-the-counter NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) are often effective for pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen may also be used.",
      "  - Heat or cold therapy: Apply a heating pad or warm compresses, or ice packs (whichever provides more relief) to the affected area.",
      "  - Gentle stretching exercises for the chest and shoulders (once acute pain subsides) may be helpful for some, but avoid movements that cause pain.",
      "  - Maintain good posture.",
      "  - Avoid pressure on the painful area (e.g., from tight clothing, seatbelts - adjust if possible).",
      "If pain is severe or persistent, your doctor may consider:",
      "  - Prescription-strength NSAIDs or other pain medications.",
      "  - Corticosteroid injection into the affected costosternal joint can provide significant relief in some cases.",

Also, if tinnitus is pulsatile (matches your heartbeat - could indicate a vascular issue) or associated with severe headache or other neurological symptoms.",
    "general_advice": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in one or both ears, or in the head, when no external sound is present. It's often described as ringing, buzzing, hissing, roaring, clicking, or humming. Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease itself, and can have many underlying causes. When a specific cause cannot be identified after a thorough evaluation, it may be considered idiopathic or of unknown cause. Common known causes include: hearing loss (age-related/presbycusis, noise-induced), earwax impaction, middle ear infections or fluid, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, head or neck injuries, certain medications (ototoxic drugs like aspirin in high doses, some antibiotics, diuretics, chemotherapy agents), cardiovascular problems (e.g., atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, vascular malformations - can cause pulsatile tinnitus), Eustachian tube dysfunction, acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma - a benign tumor on auditory nerve, rare), or neurological conditions. Tinnitus can be constant or intermittent, vary in loudness, and can be very bothersome, affecting sleep, concentration, and emotional well-being (e.g., causing anxiety, depression, irritability).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience new or persistent tinnitus, especially if it's unilateral (one ear only), pulsatile, associated with hearing loss, dizziness, or other neurological symptoms, or if it's significantly impacting your quality of life, consult your doctor (primary care, audiologist, or ENT specialist). A comprehensive hearing evaluation (audiogram) is essential. Further tests (e.g., imaging like MRI if tumor or vascular issue suspected, blood tests) may be done to look for underlying causes.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If an underlying cause is found, treating it may help reduce tinnitus (e.g., removing earwax, treating ear infection, managing TMJ, changing medication if drug-induced - discuss with doctor). For idiopathic tinnitus or when cause is not directly treatable, management focuses on reducing its perception and impact.",
      "  - Hearing protection: Avoid exposure to loud noises to prevent further hearing damage, which can worsen tinnitus.",
      "  - Sound therapy/enrichment: Using background sound (e.g., white noise machine, fan, soft music, specialized tinnitus sound apps/devices) can help make tinnitus less noticeable, especially in quiet environments or at night.",
      "  - Hearing aids: If tinnitus is associated with hearing loss (very common), hearing aids can improve hearing and often reduce perception of tinnitus by amplifying ambient sounds.",
      "  - Stress management and relaxation techniques (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, yoga, biofeedback) as stress can exacerbate tinnitus.",
      "  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT): Can help change negative thought patterns and emotional responses to tinnitus, and promote habituation (learning to ignore it).",
      "  - Limit caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine (can worsen tinnitus for some).",
      "  - Ensure adequate sleep (tinnitus can affect sleep, and poor sleep can worsen tinnitus - address sleep hygiene).",

    "general_advice": "Tonsillar hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of the palatine tonsils, which are two masses of lymphoid tissue located at the back of the throat, one on each side. Enlarged tonsils are very common, especially in children, as tonsils are part of the immune system and can enlarge in response to recurrent infections (viral or bacterial). Adenoid hypertrophy (enlarged adenoids - lymphoid tissue at back of nasal cavity) often coexists. While some degree of enlargement can be normal or temporary during an infection, chronically enlarged tonsils can sometimes cause problems. Symptoms related to tonsillar hypertrophy can include: snoring, noisy breathing during sleep, observed pauses in breathing during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea - OSA), restless sleep, daytime sleepiness or fatigue, mouth breathing, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia, especially solids), muffled voice ('hot potato' voice if very large), persistent sore throat or feeling of something stuck in throat, and sometimes bad breath (halitosis due to debris trapping in tonsillar crypts). In children, chronic OSA from enlarged tonsils/adenoids can lead to behavioral problems, learning difficulties, and failure to thrive.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has persistently enlarged tonsils causing bothersome symptoms like snoring, sleep disturbances, breathing problems, or difficulty swallowing, consult your doctor (pediatrician, primary care, or ENT specialist).

    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends on the severity of symptoms and underlying cause.",
      "  - If enlargement is due to an acute infection (e.g., viral tonsillitis, strep throat), it usually subsides as the infection resolves (with antibiotics if bacterial).",
      "  - If no significant symptoms, observation may be appropriate.",
      "  - For mild OSA or snoring in children, watchful waiting may be an option as tonsils often shrink with age. Nasal saline or corticosteroid sprays may be tried if nasal congestion is also present.",
      "  - Tonsillectomy (surgical removal of tonsils), often with adenoidectomy (T&A): This is the primary treatment if enlarged tonsils are causing significant OSA, recurrent severe tonsillitis, or other complications like difficulty swallowing or failure to thrive.

Spread of infection to surrounding tissues (cellulitis), bone (osteomyelitis), or bloodstream (sepsis) is an emergency.",
    "general_advice": "A tooth abscess, or dental abscess, is a localized collection of pus that forms as a result of a bacterial infection in or around a tooth. There are two main types: 1) Periapical abscess: Occurs at the tip of the tooth root, usually due to untreated dental caries (tooth decay) that has reached the pulp (inner nerve tissue), trauma to the tooth, or a failed root canal treatment. Bacteria infect the pulp and spread to the bone at the root tip. 2) Periodontal abscess: Occurs in the gum tissues next to a tooth, often associated with severe gum disease (periodontitis) where bacteria infect the pockets between teeth and gums, or sometimes due to a foreign object (like a popcorn hull) lodged in the gums. Symptoms of a tooth abscess can include: severe, persistent, throbbing toothache or pain (can radiate to jaw, neck, or ear); sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures or pressure from chewing/biting; swelling and redness of the gums near the affected tooth; swelling of the face or jaw; a tender, swollen lump (abscess) on the gum, sometimes with a pimple-like head that may drain pus (giving a bad taste or smell); fever; swollen lymph nodes in neck; and general malaise. Sometimes, if the abscess finds a way to drain, the acute pain may lessen, but the infection is still present.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you have a tooth abscess, see your dentist immediately or go to an urgent care/ER if a dentist is not available (especially if severe symptoms). Prompt treatment is crucial to relieve pain, drain the infection, save the tooth if possible, and prevent spread of infection.",

    "general_advice": "Tooth disorder is a broad term for any condition affecting the teeth, their structure, or supporting tissues. Common tooth disorders include: 1) Dental caries (tooth decay, cavities - see separate entry): Destruction of tooth enamel/dentin by acid-producing bacteria. 2) Pulpitis: Inflammation of the dental pulp (nerve/blood vessels inside tooth), often from deep decay or trauma. Can be reversible (mild pain to stimuli) or irreversible (severe, spontaneous, lingering pain - often needs root canal). 3) Dental abscess: Localized pus collection from infection (see separate entry). 4) Gum disease (gingivitis, periodontitis - see separate entry): Affects tissues supporting teeth. 5) Tooth impaction: Tooth (often wisdom tooth) fails to erupt fully or erupts in abnormal position. 6) Malocclusion (misaligned bite/teeth): e.g., overbite, underbite, crossbite, crowding. 7) Bruxism (teeth grinding/clenching): Can cause tooth wear, fractures, jaw pain. 8) Tooth sensitivity: Pain/discomfort from hot, cold, sweet, or acidic stimuli, often due to exposed dentin (from gum recession, enamel wear, cavities). 9) Tooth erosion: Loss of tooth enamel from acid (e.g., from acidic foods/drinks, GERD, vomiting). 10) Tooth discoloration. 11) Cracked or fractured tooth (see Broken Tooth). 12) Developmental abnormalities of teeth (e.g., enamel hypoplasia, supernumerary teeth).

    "general_advice": "Torticollis, also known as wryneck, is a condition characterized by an abnormal, asymmetrical head or neck position, where the head is tilted to one side, and the chin is often turned to the opposite side. It results from spasm, stiffness, or shortening of neck muscles, particularly the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), or sometimes due to problems with cervical vertebrae or nerves. Types include: 1) Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT - most common type in infants): Present at or shortly after birth, often due to SCM muscle injury or tightening from positioning in womb or during birth. May be associated with a palpable lump (fibrous mass) in SCM. 2) Acquired torticollis (develops later in life): Can be due to various causes, such as: minor neck muscle strain or injury, sleeping in an awkward position, upper respiratory or throat infections (can cause lymph node swelling and muscle spasm - Grisel's syndrome), trauma to cervical spine (fracture, dislocation), cervical disc herniation, tumors in neck/brain/spinal cord (rare), certain medications (drug-induced dystonia, e.g., from some antipsychotics or antiemetics), or spasmodic torticollis (cervical dystonia - a neurological movement disorder causing involuntary neck muscle contractions, often chronic and painful). Symptoms include: head tilted to one side, chin turned to other side, limited range of motion in neck, neck pain or stiffness, one shoulder may appear higher, and sometimes a headache or palpable neck muscle tightness/lump.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops torticollis, consult a doctor (pediatrician for infants, primary care or neurologist/orthopedist/ENT for adults) to determine the cause and appropriate management.

    "emergency_advice": "While TS itself is not typically an emergency, seek urgent help if: tics are causing significant self-injury (e.g., forceful head/neck movements, self-hitting); there's a sudden, severe worsening or change in tics, especially if associated with other new neurological or psychiatric symptoms; or if co-occurring conditions like severe ADHD, OCD, depression, anxiety, or rage attacks lead to suicidal thoughts, self-harm, or behavior that poses a danger to self or others.",
    "general_advice": "Tourette syndrome (TS), also known as Tourette's disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the presence of multiple motor tics AND at least one vocal (phonic) tic, which have been present for more than one year, with onset before the age of 18. Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic movements or vocalizations. They are often preceded by an uncomfortable premonitory urge or sensation that is temporarily relieved by performing the tic. Tics are usually involuntary but can often be suppressed for short periods with effort, which may then lead to a buildup of tension and a more intense outburst of tics later. Tics typically wax and wane in frequency, intensity, type, and location over time, and can be exacerbated by stress, excitement, fatigue, or anxiety. Motor tics can be simple (e.g., eye blinking, nose twitching, head jerking) or complex (e.g., facial grimacing, touching, jumping, smelling objects, sometimes self-injurious tics). Vocal tics can be simple (e.g., throat clearing, sniffing, grunting, barking) or complex (e.g., repeating words/phrases - echolalia/palilalia, or rarely, uttering socially inappropriate words/obscenities - coprolalia, which occurs in only about 10-15% of cases despite common misconception). TS is often associated with co-occurring conditions, most commonly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, sleep problems, and rage attacks. The exact cause is unknown but involves genetic and neurobiological factors (dysfunction in brain circuits involving basal ganglia, thalamus, cortex, and neurotransmitters like dopamine).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops tics that are persistent, bothersome, causing distress, interfering with daily activities, school, or social interactions, or if you have concerns about co-occurring conditions, consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist, or psychiatrist/psychologist specializing in tic disorders/TS). Diagnosis is based on clinical history and observation of tics, meeting diagnostic criteria, and ruling out other causes.",

Also, if goiter causes acute, severe difficulty breathing or swallowing.",
    "general_advice": "Toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), also known as Plummer's disease, is a common cause of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland), especially in older individuals and in areas with iodine deficiency (though can occur in iodine-sufficient areas too). It develops from a long-standing multinodular goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple nodules or lumps - see Goiter/Thyroid Nodule entries). In TMNG, one or more of these nodules become 'autonomous' or 'toxic,' meaning they produce excess thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) independently of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) regulation from the pituitary gland. This leads to hyperthyroidism. Symptoms are those of an overactive thyroid and can include: unintentional weight loss despite normal or increased appetite, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation is common), nervousness, anxiety, irritability, tremors (fine shaking, often in hands), heat intolerance, increased sweating, fatigue, muscle weakness, changes in bowel habits (more frequent), goiter (enlarged, often lumpy thyroid), and sometimes sleep disturbances. Unlike Graves' disease (another common cause of hyperthyroidism), TMNG is usually not associated with eye problems (ophthalmopathy) or pretibial myxedema. Symptoms often develop gradually and may be less dramatic than in Graves' disease, especially in elderly patients who may present with 'apathetic hyperthyroidism' (e.g., fatigue, weight loss, depression, atrial fibrillation, heart failure).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism or have a known multinodular goiter and develop new symptoms, consult your doctor (primary care or endocrinologist). Diagnosis involves blood tests (TSH - usually low or suppressed, and free T4/T3 - usually elevated or high-normal), and a thyroid scan (radioactive iodine uptake and scan - typically shows multiple areas of increased uptake - 'hot' nodules, with suppressed uptake in rest of gland, or a diffuse patchy pattern). Thyroid ultrasound is also done to evaluate nodules.",

      "  - Radioactive iodine therapy (RAI): Often the preferred definitive treatment. Radioactive iodine is taken orally, concentrates in the overactive thyroid nodules, and destroys them, reducing hormone production. Usually leads to hypothyroidism over time, requiring lifelong thyroid hormone replacement (levothyroxine).",
      "  - Thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy - total or subtotal): Removal of all or most of the thyroid gland. Also leads to hypothyroidism requiring lifelong hormone replacement.

Also, if a pregnant woman acquires acute toxoplasmosis, urgent consultation with an obstetrician/infectious disease specialist is needed due to risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in the fetus. Severe ocular toxoplasmosis (eye infection) with vision loss also needs urgent ophthalmological care.",
    "general_advice": "Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled parasite called *Toxoplasma gondii*. It's a common parasite found worldwide. Infection can occur by: 1) Ingesting undercooked or contaminated meat (especially pork, lamb, venison) containing tissue cysts. 2) Ingesting food or water contaminated with oocysts (egg-like forms) from infected cat feces (e.g., from contaminated soil, unwashed fruits/vegetables, or cleaning a cat litter box - cats are definitive hosts and shed oocysts in feces after primary infection). 3) Mother-to-child transmission (congenital toxoplasmosis): If a woman acquires acute infection during pregnancy (or shortly before), she can pass it to her fetus, potentially causing serious birth defects or problems later in life (e.g., vision loss, hearing loss, intellectual disability, seizures). 4) Rarely, through organ transplantation or blood transfusion from an infected donor. In most healthy, immunocompetent individuals, toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic or causes a mild, self-limiting, flu-like illness with symptoms like swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy, especially in neck), muscle aches, fever, sore throat, and fatigue, which usually resolves without treatment. However, in people with weakened immune systems, toxoplasmosis can reactivate (if previously infected) or cause severe, life-threatening disease, most commonly toxoplasmic encephalitis (brain infection). Ocular toxoplasmosis (infection of the retina/choroid) can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, causing blurred vision, eye pain, floaters, and potential vision loss.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you are pregnant or immunocompromised and concerned about toxoplasmosis exposure or symptoms, consult your doctor. Also, if you develop symptoms of ocular toxoplasmosis or severe systemic illness suggestive of disseminated toxoplasmosis. Diagnosis involves blood tests for *Toxoplasma* antibodies (IgM and IgG - interpretation can be complex, especially in pregnancy or immunocompromised).

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if a child or adult develops: severe difficulty breathing, stridor (high-pitched whistling sound with breathing, often both inspiratory and expiratory), high fever, rapidly worsening cough (often harsh, brassy, or croup-like initially, but may become productive of thick, pus-like secretions), drooling, cyanosis (bluish skin/lips), or appears very ill, agitated, or lethargic. This requires urgent hospital care to secure the airway and treat infection.",
    "general_advice": "Tracheitis is an inflammation of the trachea (windpipe). While mild tracheitis can occur with viral upper respiratory infections (like a cold or flu, causing a cough), the term 'bacterial tracheitis' (also known as pseudomembranous croup or bacterial laryngotracheobronchitis) refers to a serious bacterial infection of the trachea, often occurring as a secondary infection after a preceding viral upper respiratory illness (e.g., influenza, parainfluenza, RSV). It's more common in young children (typically ages 6 months to 6 years) but can affect older children and adults. In bacterial tracheitis, the lining of the trachea becomes inflamed, swollen, and produces thick, pus-like secretions and sometimes pseudomembranes (false membranes) that can narrow and obstruct the airway, making breathing very difficult. Common bacteria involved include *Staphylococcus aureus* (including MRSA), *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae* (less common now due to Hib vaccine), and *Moraxella catarrhalis*. Symptoms often start like croup (barking cough, stridor, hoarseness) or a severe cold, but then rapidly worsen with high fever, toxic appearance, progressive respiratory distress, and productive cough with purulent secretions, often unresponsive to typical croup treatments (like nebulized epinephrine or steroids).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if bacterial tracheitis is suspected. Diagnosis is often made based on clinical presentation (rapidly worsening airway obstruction with fever and purulent secretions, often after viral URI, poor response to croup therapy). Direct visualization of the trachea (laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy) may show inflammation, pus, and pseudomembranes, and allow for culture of secretions. Neck/chest X-rays may show subglottic narrowing (like croup) but sometimes a shaggy tracheal outline or pseudomembranes.",

Use the FAST acronym: F - Face drooping, A - Arm weakness, S - Speech difficulty, T - Time to call emergency services. Other sudden symptoms can include: numbness or weakness (especially on one side), confusion, trouble understanding, vision problems, dizziness, loss of balance/coordination. Do not ignore these symptoms or wait to see if they go away.",
    "general_advice": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA), often called a 'mini-stroke,' is a temporary episode of neurological dysfunction caused by a brief interruption of blood flow to a part of the brain, spinal cord, or retina, without causing permanent tissue damage (infarction). The blockage is usually due to a small blood clot or piece of atherosclerotic plaque that temporarily obstructs an artery, then dislodges or dissolves, restoring blood flow before permanent damage occurs. Symptoms of a TIA are the same as those of an ischemic stroke but are transient, typically lasting only a few minutes to an hour (by definition, resolve completely within 24 hours, though most last much shorter). Having a TIA means you are at very high risk of having a full-blown stroke soon, so it's a critical warning that needs immediate investigation and treatment to prevent a future stroke. Risk factors are the same as for ischemic stroke (e.g., high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, smoking, carotid artery disease, age, family history).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate emergency medical evaluation in a hospital with stroke capabilities is essential for any suspected TIA. Diagnosis involves a thorough neurological exam, brain imaging (CT or MRI - usually normal in TIA as no permanent damage, but helps rule out stroke or other causes, and can sometimes show areas at risk), vascular imaging (e.g., carotid ultrasound, CT/MR angiography - to look for source of clot/plaque), EKG, echocardiogram (to check for heart sources of emboli like AFib), and blood tests.",

Chronic rubbing of lashes on cornea can lead to serious complications.",
    "general_advice": "Trichiasis is a common eyelid abnormality where eyelashes grow inward, towards the eye, and rub against the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) and conjunctiva (the clear membrane covering the white of the eye and lining eyelids). This constant rubbing can cause irritation, pain, redness, tearing, a foreign body sensation (feeling like something is in the eye), light sensitivity (photophobia), and can lead to corneal abrasions (scratches), corneal ulcers, scarring, and potentially vision loss if chronic or severe. Causes of trichiasis can include: chronic blepharitis (eyelid inflammation), previous eye infections (e.g., trachoma - a major cause worldwide, herpes zoster ophthalmicus), trauma or injury to the eyelid, burns, autoimmune conditions (e.g., ocular cicatricial pemphigoid), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or age-related changes in eyelid structure. It's different from entropion, where the eyelid margin itself turns inward, causing normally positioned lashes to rub the eye (though entropion often leads to trichiasis).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have eyelashes rubbing against your eye or experience symptoms of trichiasis, consult an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist).

Also, if muscle pain and weakness are extreme and debilitating, or if there are signs of severe allergic/inflammatory reactions.",
    "general_advice": "Trichinosis, also known as trichinellosis, is a parasitic disease caused by ingesting larvae of a type of roundworm called *Trichinella*. Infection occurs by eating raw or undercooked meat (most commonly pork from domestic pigs or wild game like bear, boar, walrus) that is contaminated with *Trichinella* cysts containing larvae. Once ingested, stomach acid dissolves the cysts, releasing larvae which then mature into adult worms in the small intestine. Female worms release new larvae that penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system, and migrate to striated (skeletal) muscles throughout thebody, where they encyst (form new cysts). The severity of illness depends on the number of larvae ingested. Many infections are asymptomatic or mild. Symptoms occur in two phases: 1) Intestinal (enteric) phase (1-2 days to 1 week after ingestion): May cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and fever (can mimic food poisoning). 2) Muscle (parenteral) phase (usually 2-8 weeks after ingestion, as larvae migrate and encyst in muscles): Hallmark symptoms include muscle pain (myalgia - can be severe), muscle tenderness and swelling, weakness, fever, chills, fatigue, and sometimes periorbital edema (swelling around eyes), conjunctivitis, rash, splinter hemorrhages under nails, and eosinophilia (high eosinophil count in blood). Severe muscle involvement can affect diaphragm (breathing muscles) or jaw/tongue muscles (difficulty chewing/swallowing/speaking). Myocarditis and CNS involvement are serious complications.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you develop symptoms suggestive of trichinosis, especially muscle pain, fever, and facial swelling, after consuming raw or undercooked pork or wild game, consult your doctor. Diagnosis involves a medical history (including food exposure), physical exam, blood tests (CBC for eosinophilia, muscle enzymes like CK may be elevated, serology for *Trichinella* antibodies - usually positive a few weeks after infection), and sometimes a muscle biopsy (to look for larvae in muscle tissue - less common now).",

In women, symptoms can include: a profuse, frothy, thin vaginal discharge that is often yellowish-green or grayish and may have a foul or fishy odor; vaginal itching, irritation, redness, and soreness (vulvovaginitis); pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia); and painful or frequent urination (dysuria). The cervix may sometimes have tiny red spots ('strawberry cervix' - colpitis macularis), visible on pelvic exam. In men, symptoms (if present) are often milder and can include: irritation or itching inside the penis; mild discharge from the urethra (thin, whitish); or slight burning or pain after urination or ejaculation.

Severe, symptomatic tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation can require intervention.",
    "general_advice": "Tricuspid valve disease affects the tricuspid valve, which is located between the right atrium (upper right chamber of the heart) and the right ventricle (lower right chamber). It has three leaflets (cusps) and opens to allow deoxygenated blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle, and closes to prevent blood from flowing backward. Tricuspid valve disease can be: 1) Tricuspid stenosis (TS): Narrowing of the tricuspid valve opening, restricting blood flow from right atrium to right ventricle. This is rare and usually caused by rheumatic heart disease. Can also be congenital or due to carcinoid syndrome. 2) Tricuspid regurgitation (TR, tricuspid insufficiency): The valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to leak backward from the right ventricle into the right atrium when the ventricle contracts. Mild TR is common and often benign. Significant TR is often 'functional' or 'secondary,' meaning it's due to right ventricular enlargement or dysfunction (e.g., from left-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or right ventricular infarction) causing the valve annulus (ring) to dilate, rather than a primary problem with the valve leaflets themselves. Primary TR can be caused by rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis (especially in IV drug users), carcinoid syndrome, trauma, congenital defects (e.g., Ebstein's anomaly), or pacemaker lead impingement. Symptoms of significant tricuspid valve disease are often related to right heart failure and systemic venous congestion, and can include: fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath (especially with exertion), swelling (edema) in legs, ankles, feet, and abdomen (ascites), pulsating or fluttering sensation in the neck (due to prominent jugular venous pulse), enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and sometimes a bluish tint to skin (cyanosis if severe or with shunts).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of tricuspid valve disease or right heart failure, or if a heart murmur is detected, consult your doctor (primary care or cardiologist).

Seek urgent medical attention if pain is unbearable and uncontrolled, or if there are suicidal ideations. Also, if new neurological symptoms develop alongside the facial pain (e.g., constant facial numbness, weakness, vision/hearing changes), this could suggest an underlying structural cause (like a tumor or MS) that needs evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also known as tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition characterized by sudden, severe, shock-like or stabbing episodes of facial pain, typically affecting one side of the face. The pain follows the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve (5th cranial nerve), which supplies sensation to the face and controls muscles used for chewing. TN pain is often described as one of the most excruciating pains known. Attacks are usually brief (lasting seconds to a couple of minutes) but can occur in rapid succession or in volleys lasting longer. Pain is often triggered by normally non-painful stimuli (allodynia) in specific 'trigger zones' on the face, such as light touch, talking, chewing, brushing teeth, shaving, washing face, or even a breeze. Between attacks, there may be no pain, or a dull ache. There are two main types: 1) Classic (Typical) TN: Caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve root by a blood vessel (artery or vein) as it exits the brainstem. This is the most common type. 2) Symptomatic (Secondary) TN: Caused by an underlying condition affecting the trigeminal nerve, such as a tumor, multiple sclerosis (MS), cyst, arteriovenous malformation, or injury. Atypical TN has more constant, burning, or aching pain with less distinct trigger zones.",

    "general_advice": "Trigger finger, or trigger thumb (if affecting thumb), also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, is a condition characterized by pain, stiffness, and a sensation of locking or catching when bending and straightening a finger or thumb. The affected finger may get stuck in a bent position and then suddenly snap straight, like a trigger being pulled and released. It occurs when the flexor tendon (which bends the finger/thumb) or its sheath (the tunnel it runs through) in the palm at the base of the finger/thumb becomes inflamed or thickened. This can cause a nodule to form on the tendon, or the sheath to narrow, making it difficult for the tendon to glide smoothly through the sheath. When the nodule tries to pass through the narrowed sheath, it can catch, causing the locking or triggering sensation. The exact cause is often unknown, but it's associated with repetitive or forceful gripping motions, certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, thyroid disorders), and is more common in women and older adults.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms of trigger finger that are persistent, painful, or interfering with hand function, consult your doctor (primary care, orthopedist, or hand specialist). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical exam (palpating a tender nodule at base of finger/thumb, observing triggering).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Conservative treatment is often effective, especially if started early.",
      "  - Rest and activity modification: Avoid or reduce activities that involve repetitive gripping, forceful finger movements, or prolonged use of vibrating tools. This is the most important initial step.",
      "  - Splinting: Wearing a splint, especially at night, to keep the affected finger or thumb in an extended (straight) position can help rest the tendon and reduce inflammation.",
      "  - Gentle stretching exercises for the finger/thumb (as advised by doctor or therapist once acute inflammation subsides).",
      "  - Over-the-counter NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) for pain and inflammation.",
      "  - Applying ice or heat may provide some symptomatic relief.",
      "Medical treatments (if conservative measures fail):",
      "  - Corticosteroid injection: Injecting a corticosteroid medication into the tendon sheath at the site of the nodule/thickening is often very effective in reducing inflammation and relieving symptoms. One or two injections may be needed.",
      "  - Percutaneous release (needle release): A minimally invasive procedure where a needle is used (often under ultrasound guidance) to break up the constricted tissue around the tendon sheath.",
      "  - Surgical release (trigger finger release): If other treatments are not successful, a minor surgical procedure (usually outpatient, under local anesthesia) can be done to cut the constricted part of the tendon sheath (A1 pulley), allowing the tendon to glide freely. This is usually very effective.",

Untreated or drug-resistant TB can be fatal.",
    "general_advice": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It primarily affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB), such as the lymph nodes, bones and joints, kidneys, brain (meninges), pleura, abdomen, or skin. TB is spread through the air when a person with active pulmonary TB coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, releasing tiny droplets containing the bacteria, which are then inhaled by others. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. There are two main TB-related conditions: 1) Latent TB Infection (LTBI): The person has TB bacteria in their body, but the immune system keeps them inactive, so they have no symptoms and are not contagious. However, they are at risk of developing active TB disease later in life if their immune system weakens. 2) Active TB Disease: The TB bacteria are active and multiplying, causing illness. This form is contagious (if pulmonary or laryngeal). Symptoms of active pulmonary TB can include: a persistent cough lasting 3 weeks or longer (may produce sputum or blood), chest pain, fever, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss. Symptoms of extrapulmonary TB depend on the site affected. Risk factors for developing active TB disease after infection include: weakened immune system (e.g., HIV/AIDS - very strong risk factor, diabetes, kidney failure, malnutrition, on immunosuppressive drugs), young children, elderly, substance abuse, or recent TB infection.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of active TB, especially a persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss, or if you have been in close contact with someone with active TB, or if you have risk factors and are concerned, consult your doctor or local health department. Diagnosis of LTBI involves a tuberculin skin test (TST/Mantoux) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA - blood test). Diagnosis of active TB disease involves a medical history, physical exam, chest X-ray (often shows infiltrates or cavities in lungs), sputum smear and culture (to detect TB bacteria - crucial for confirming diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing), and sometimes molecular tests (e.g., PCR).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Active TB disease requires treatment with a specific combination of antibiotic medications for several months (usually 6-9 months or longer for drug-resistant TB) to cure the infection and prevent spread. It is crucial to take all medications exactly as prescribed for the full duration, even if you start to feel better. Incomplete or improper treatment can lead to drug-resistant TB, which is much harder to treat.",
      "  - Common first-line anti-TB drugs include isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB).",
      "  - Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is often recommended, where a healthcare worker watches the person take their medication, to ensure adherence.",
      "Treatment for Latent TB Infection (LTBI) is also recommended for many individuals (especially those at high risk of progressing to active disease) to prevent development of active TB. Shorter regimens (e.g., 3-4 months) with drugs like isoniazid and rifapentine, or rifampin alone, are now common.",
      "During active pulmonary TB (until no longer contagious - usually after a few weeks of effective treatment, as determined by doctor):",
      "  - Stay home from work/school. Avoid close contact with others.",

Seek immediate medical attention for: uncontrolled seizures or status epilepticus; acute signs of increased intracranial pressure from a growing brain tumor (e.g., SEGA - subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) or hydrocephalus (severe headache, persistent vomiting, lethargy, vision changes); sudden, severe abdominal or flank pain with blood in urine (could be bleeding from an angiomyolipoma - AML - in kidney); acute respiratory distress (if severe lung involvement - lymphangioleiomyomatosis - LAM); or acute cardiac event (if rhabdomyomas cause arrhythmias or obstruction in infancy).",
    "general_advice": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, multisystem genetic disorder characterized by the growth of benign (non-cancerous) tumors called hamartomas in various organs, most commonly the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, and eyes. It's caused by mutations in either the TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin) gene, which normally act as tumor suppressors, regulating cell growth and division. TSC can be inherited (autosomal dominant - about 1/3 of cases) or result from a new, spontaneous mutation (about 2/3 of cases). The manifestations of TSC are highly variable, ranging from very mild (some individuals may be undiagnosed) to severe and life-limiting. Common features include: 1) Brain: Cortical tubers (areas of abnormal brain development), subependymal nodules (SENs), and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs - benign brain tumors that can grow and block CSF flow, causing hydrocephalus). These can lead to epilepsy (seizures - very common, often starting in infancy as infantile spasms), intellectual disability (varying degrees), developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and behavioral problems (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, aggression). 2) Skin: Hypomelanotic macules ('ash-leaf spots' - pale patches), facial angiofibromas (adenoma sebaceum - reddish bumps on face, especially cheeks/nose), shagreen patches (thickened, leathery skin, often on lower back), fibrous cephalic plaques (on forehead/scalp), ungual fibromas (growths around/under nails). 3) Kidneys: Angiomyolipomas (AMLs - benign tumors of fat, muscle, blood vessels; can bleed if large), renal cysts. Can lead to kidney problems. 4) Heart: Cardiac rhabdomyomas (benign tumors in heart muscle, often present in infancy, may regress spontaneously; can cause arrhythmias or obstruct blood flow if large). 5) Lungs: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM - progressive cystic lung disease, almost exclusively in adult women with TSC, can cause shortness of breath, pneumothorax). 6) Eyes: Retinal hamartomas.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a child or adult has signs or symptoms suggestive of TSC (e.g., characteristic skin lesions, seizures, developmental delays, family history), consult a doctor (pediatrician, neurologist, geneticist, or dermatologist).

Also, if experiencing severe, uncontrolled symptoms despite usual treatment.",
    "general_advice": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers (sores) in the innermost lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. The inflammation usually begins in the rectum and can extend continuously upwards to involve part or all of the colon. It does not affect the small intestine (unlike Crohn's disease, which can affect any part of the GI tract). The exact cause is unknown but involves an abnormal immune system response, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors. UC is characterized by periods of active inflammation (flares) and periods of remission. Symptoms during a flare can include: bloody diarrhea (often with mucus and pus), rectal bleeding, urgent need to defecate (tenesmus), frequent bowel movements, abdominal pain and cramping (usually lower left side), fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, and sometimes fever. UC can also have extra-intestinal manifestations (affecting other parts of body like joints, skin, eyes, liver). Long-standing, extensive UC increases the risk of colon cancer.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, or other symptoms suggestive of UC, consult your doctor (primary care or gastroenterologist). Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam, blood tests (for inflammation, anemia), stool tests (to rule out infection), and endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) with biopsies of the colon/rectum (key for diagnosis and assessing extent/severity).",

      "    - Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone - oral; budesonide - oral or rectal; IV steroids for severe flares): Used for moderate to severe flares to rapidly reduce inflammation (short-term use due to side effects).",
      "    - Immunomodulators (e.g., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate): Used to help maintain remission and reduce need for steroids.",
      "    - Biologic therapies (e.g., TNF inhibitors like infliximab/adalimumab/golimumab; vedolizumab; ustekinumab; JAK inhibitors like tofacitinib/upadacitinib - oral biologics): For moderate to severe UC unresponsive to other treatments.",
      "  - Dietary modifications: During flares, a low-residue/low-fiber diet may help reduce symptoms. Identify and avoid personal trigger foods (e.g., dairy if lactose intolerant, greasy/spicy foods). Maintain good nutrition and hydration. A dietitian can help.",
      "  - Stress management: Stress doesn't cause UC but can worsen symptoms.",
      "  - Surgery (colectomy - removal of colon and rectum): May be needed for severe, refractory UC, complications like toxic megacolon/perforation, or to prevent/treat colon cancer. Often involves creation of an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA or 'j-pouch') to allow for normal defecation, or sometimes a permanent ileostomy.",

    "general_advice": "Urethral disorder is a broad term for any condition affecting the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In males, the urethra also carries semen. Common urethral disorders include: 1) Urethritis: Inflammation/infection of the urethra (see separate entry). Often caused by STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia) or other bacteria. Symptoms: painful urination, penile/vaginal discharge, itching. 2) Urethral stricture: Narrowing of the urethra due to scarring (from previous infection, trauma, surgery, or instrumentation). Symptoms: weak urine stream, straining to urinate, incomplete bladder emptying, spraying of urine, recurrent UTIs. (See separate entry). 3) Urethral caruncle: A benign, reddish, fleshy growth at the external urethral meatus (opening) in postmenopausal women, often due to estrogen deficiency. Can cause pain, bleeding, dysuria. 4) Urethral diverticulum: A pouch or outpouching that forms along the urethra. Can cause recurrent UTIs, dribbling, pain. 5) Urethral trauma/injury: From straddle injuries, pelvic fractures, catheterization. 6) Urethral polyps or tumors (benign or malignant - rare). 7) Meatal stenosis: Narrowing of the urethral opening, more common in circumcised boys. Symptoms vary greatly depending on the specific disorder but can include pain or burning during urination (dysuria), frequent or urgent urination, difficulty starting urination, weak or interrupted urine stream, discharge from urethra, blood in urine (hematuria), or pain in genital area.",

    "general_advice": "A urethral stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. This narrowing is usually caused by scar tissue (fibrosis) forming in the urethra, which restricts urine flow. Causes of urethral strictures include: 1) Trauma or injury to the urethra: e.g., from straddle injuries (falling onto something hard in perineum), pelvic fractures, previous urethral instrumentation (catheterization, cystoscopy, surgery), or prostate surgery (e.g., TURP). 2) Infection or inflammation of the urethra (urethritis): e.g., from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea, or sometimes balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO)/lichen sclerosus affecting urethra. 3) Congenital (present at birth - rare). 4) Idiopathic (unknown cause). Symptoms often develop gradually and can include: weak or diminished urine stream, straining to urinate, spraying or splitting of urine stream, incomplete bladder emptying (feeling like bladder isn't empty after urinating), needing to urinate frequently or urgently, dribbling after urination, pain during urination (dysuria), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and sometimes blood in urine or semen.

If a newborn male infant shows signs of urinary obstruction such as: poor urine stream (dribbling), straining to urinate, distended bladder (palpable abdominal mass), recurrent UTIs with fever, poor feeding, failure to thrive, or respiratory distress (due to lung underdevelopment - pulmonary hypoplasia, if severe oligohydramnios in utero), seek immediate medical attention. Acute urinary retention is an emergency.",
    "general_advice": "Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are obstructing flaps of tissue that are congenitally present in the posterior urethra (the part of the urethra closest to the bladder) in male infants. These valves act like a one-way obstruction, making it difficult for urine to flow out of the bladder and urethra. This blockage causes increased pressure in the bladder, ureters, and kidneys, which can lead to: hydronephrosis (swelling of kidneys), hydroureter (swelling of ureters), bladder dysfunction (e.g., thickened, poorly compliant bladder), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR - backward flow of urine from bladder to kidneys), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and progressive kidney damage (renal dysplasia or chronic kidney disease/failure). The severity can range from mild to life-threatening. PUV is one of the most common causes of lower urinary tract obstruction in male newborns.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "PUV is often suspected prenatally on ultrasound (showing bilateral hydronephrosis, distended bladder, oligohydramnios - low amniotic fluid). If diagnosed after birth (due to symptoms or abnormal postnatal ultrasound), prompt evaluation by a pediatric urologist and nephrologist is crucial. Diagnosis is confirmed with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG - X-ray taken while bladder is filled with contrast and during urination, shows dilated posterior urethra and valve leaflets).

It's often caused by an infection, but can also be due to non-infectious irritation. 1) Infectious urethritis: Most commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Gonococcal urethritis (GU) is caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (gonorrhea). Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is caused by other organisms, most frequently *Chlamydia trachomatis* (chlamydia), but also *Mycoplasma genitalium*, *Trichomonas vaginalis*, Ureaplasma, or herpes simplex virus. NGU can also sometimes be caused by bacteria that normally cause UTIs (e.g., *E. coli*). 2) Non-infectious urethritis: Can be caused by irritation from chemicals (e.g., spermicides, soaps, contraceptive jellies), trauma (e.g., from catheterization, sexual activity, or foreign objects), or sometimes as part of a systemic inflammatory condition (e.g., reactive arthritis). Symptoms are more common and noticeable in men than women. In men, symptoms include: dysuria (pain, burning, or discomfort during urination, often at tip of penis), urethral discharge (can be watery, milky, yellowish, greenish, or pus-like), itching or irritation at urethral opening, and sometimes frequent or urgent urination. In women, symptoms may be mild or absent, but can include dysuria, increased vaginal discharge (if associated cervicitis), or abdominal pain. Untreated infectious urethritis can lead to complications (e.g., epididymitis, prostatitis, PID, infertility, spread of infection).",

It's a key symptom of overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, which also includes urinary frequency (urinating often, e.g., >8 times in 24 hours), urgency, and often nocturia (waking up at night to urinate). In urge incontinence ('OAB wet'), the bladder muscle (detrusor) contracts involuntarily or becomes overactive, even when the bladder is not full, leading to leakage before the person can reach a toilet. The amount of leakage can range from a few drops to a complete emptying of the bladder. Causes of OAB and urge incontinence can include: neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury), bladder irritants (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, acidic foods, artificial sweeteners), urinary tract infections (UTIs), bladder stones or tumors (rarely), interstitial cystitis, constipation, side effects of some medications, or idiopathic (unknown cause - common). It's more common with aging and in women (especially after menopause), but can affect men too (sometimes related to BPH).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience urge incontinence or other OAB symptoms that are bothersome or affect your daily life, consult your doctor (primary care, urologist, or gynecologist/urogynecologist). They will take a medical history, perform a physical exam (including pelvic/rectal exam), urinalysis (to rule out infection/blood), and may ask you to keep a bladder diary. Urodynamic testing or cystoscopy may be done in some cases to further evaluate bladder function and rule out other conditions.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management aims to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. Often a combination of behavioral therapies and sometimes medication is used.",
      "Behavioral therapies (often first-line):",
      "  - Bladder training: Gradually increasing the time between voiding to train the bladder to hold more urine and reduce urgency. Involves scheduled voiding and urge suppression techniques (e.g., pelvic floor muscle contractions/Kegels, distraction, relaxation).",
      "  - Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegel exercises): Strengthening these muscles can help improve bladder control and suppress urgency.",
      "  - Fluid management: Drink adequate fluids, but avoid excessive intake, especially before bedtime or going out. Limit bladder irritants.",
      "  - Dietary changes: Identify and avoid personal food/drink triggers.",
      "  - Weight management if overweight (can reduce pressure on bladder).",
      "  - Manage constipation.",

Also seek care if pregnant and have UTI symptoms, if symptoms are severe, or if you are diabetic or immunocompromised.",
    "general_advice": "A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters (tubes from kidneys to bladder), bladder, and urethra (tube from bladder out of body). Most UTIs involve the lower urinary tract - the bladder (cystitis - see separate entry) and urethra (urethritis - see separate entry). UTIs are very common, especially in women (due to shorter urethra, making it easier for bacteria to reach bladder). They are usually caused by bacteria, most commonly *Escherichia coli* (E. coli) from the digestive tract, that enter the urethra and multiply in the bladder. Symptoms of a lower UTI (cystitis/urethritis) typically include: a strong, persistent urge to urinate (urgency); frequent urination, often in small amounts (frequency); a burning sensation or pain during urination (dysuria); pelvic discomfort or pressure in the lower abdomen; cloudy, dark, or strong-smelling urine; and sometimes blood in the urine. Older adults may have atypical symptoms like confusion or incontinence.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect you have a UTI, consult your doctor. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and urinalysis (urine test to check for white blood cells, bacteria, nitrites).

Bilateral UTO or UTO in a solitary kidney can rapidly lead to kidney damage.",
    "general_advice": "Urinary tract obstruction (UTO) is a blockage at any point in the urinary system that impedes the normal flow of urine from the kidneys, through the ureters, to the bladder, and out through the urethra. The blockage can be partial or complete, acute (sudden) or chronic (gradual), and unilateral (affecting one kidney/ureter) or bilateral (affecting both). Obstruction can lead to a backup of urine, causing increased pressure within the urinary tract, which can lead to hydroureter (swelling of ureter), hydronephrosis (swelling of kidney - see separate entry), kidney damage (renal parenchymal atrophy, chronic kidney disease/failure), and increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) or kidney stones. Causes of UTO are numerous and vary by age and sex. In adults, common causes include: 1) Upper tract (kidney/ureter): Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis/ureterolithiasis - most common acute cause), tumors (e.g., ureteral, renal pelvis, or extrinsic tumors compressing ureter), blood clots, ureteral strictures (narrowing from scarring), congenital abnormalities (e.g., ureteropelvic junction - UPJ obstruction, ureterovesical junction - UVJ obstruction), retroperitoneal fibrosis. 2) Lower tract (bladder/urethra): Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer in men (most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in older men), urethral strictures, bladder stones, bladder tumors, neurogenic bladder (impaired bladder function), pelvic organ prolapse in women, phimosis or meatal stenosis. Symptoms depend on location, severity, and acuity of obstruction. Acute obstruction often causes severe pain (renal colic if in ureter). Chronic obstruction may be asymptomatic or cause subtle symptoms like changes in urination (frequency, urgency, weak stream, hesitancy, nocturia), flank or abdominal pain (can be dull), recurrent UTIs, or hematuria. Bilateral obstruction or obstruction of a solitary kidney can lead to kidney failure.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience symptoms suggestive of urinary tract obstruction, consult your doctor (primary care, urologist, or nephrologist). Diagnosis involves a medical history, physical exam, urine tests, blood tests (kidney function), and imaging (ultrasound is often first-line to detect hydronephrosis/hydroureter; CT scan, MRI, nuclear medicine renal scan - MAG3 scan, or specialized X-rays like IVP/urethrogram may also be used to identify site and cause of obstruction). Cystoscopy or ureteroscopy may be needed.",

    "severity_level": "Emergency",
    "emergency_advice": "Uterine atony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and is a life-threatening obstetric emergency. If a woman is experiencing heavy, uncontrolled vaginal bleeding after childbirth (soaking more than one pad per hour, passing large clots), or shows signs of shock (rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, pale/cold/clammy skin, dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness), call for immediate emergency medical help (e.g., alert hospital staff if still in hospital, or call 911 if at home). Rapid intervention is critical to control bleeding and prevent maternal death.",
    "general_advice": "Uterine atony refers to the failure of the uterus to contract effectively after childbirth (delivery of baby and placenta). Normally, after the placenta separates and is delivered, the uterine muscles contract vigorously to constrict the blood vessels at the placental implantation site, thereby preventing excessive bleeding. In uterine atony, the uterus remains soft, boggy, and 'atonic' (lacking muscle tone) instead of becoming firm and contracted. This leads to continued, often profuse, bleeding from the placental site (postpartum hemorrhage - PPH). Risk factors for uterine atony include: prolonged labor, augmented labor (e.g., with oxytocin), rapid labor, multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets - overdistended uterus), polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid - overdistended uterus), large baby (macrosomia - overdistended uterus), retained placental fragments, infection of uterus (chorioamnionitis), use of certain medications during labor (e.g., magnesium sulfate, some anesthetics), previous uterine atony or PPH, high parity (many previous births), uterine fibroids, or full bladder.",

While not usually an acute emergency in early stages, significant bleeding needs evaluation. Complications from advanced uterine cancer (e.g., obstruction, severe pain) also need urgent care.",
    "general_advice": "Uterine cancer refers to cancer that begins in the uterus (womb). There are two main types: 1) Endometrial cancer (most common type of uterine cancer): Arises from the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. Most are adenocarcinomas. Strongly linked to estrogen exposure. (See separate entry for Endometrial Cancer for more detail). 2) Uterine sarcoma (rare, <10% of uterine cancers): Arises from the muscle layer (myometrium - e.g., leiomyosarcoma) or connective tissue of the uterus. Tend to be more aggressive than endometrial cancer. Symptoms vary by type. For endometrial cancer, the most common symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding (postmenopausal bleeding, heavy/irregular periods, intermenstrual bleeding). Other symptoms can include abnormal vaginal discharge, pelvic pain/pressure, or pain during intercourse. Uterine sarcomas may present with abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain/pressure, a rapidly enlarging uterus or palpable mass, or frequent urination. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include factors increasing estrogen exposure (obesity, unopposed estrogen therapy, early menarche/late menopause, nulliparity, PCOS, tamoxifen), older age, diabetes, Lynch syndrome. Risk factors for uterine sarcoma are less clear but may include previous pelvic radiation or tamoxifen use (for some types).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding (especially postmenopausal bleeding), or other concerning pelvic symptoms, consult your doctor or gynecologist promptly. Diagnosis involves a pelvic exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and often an endometrial biopsy or D&C with hysteroscopy. For suspected sarcoma, imaging (MRI, CT) is important, and diagnosis is usually confirmed after surgical removal of uterus.",

    "general_advice": "Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomas or myomas, are common benign (non-cancerous) tumors that grow in or on the muscular wall of the uterus (myometrium). They are made of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective tissue. Fibroids can vary greatly in size (from very small, seedling-like, to very large, grapefruit-sized or bigger), number (single or multiple), and location within the uterus (submucosal - jutting into uterine cavity, intramural - within uterine wall, subserosal - on outer surface of uterus, pedunculated - attached by a stalk). Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they depend on the size, number, and location of fibroids and can include: heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia - can lead to anemia), bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding), pelvic pain or pressure (feeling of fullness, discomfort), frequent urination or difficulty emptying bladder (if fibroid presses on bladder), constipation or difficulty with bowel movements (if fibroid presses on rectum), backache or leg pains, pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), and sometimes infertility or pregnancy complications (e.g., miscarriage, preterm labor, abnormal fetal presentation). Fibroids are common during reproductive years and are influenced by hormones (estrogen, progesterone); they often shrink after menopause. Risk factors include: African-American race (higher incidence and often earlier onset/more severe), family history, obesity, early menarche, diet high in red meat/low in fruits/vegetables.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience heavy/prolonged periods, pelvic pain/pressure, or other bothersome symptoms that might be related to fibroids, consult your doctor or gynecologist.

Newborns with multiple VACTERL features require immediate, intensive neonatal and surgical care.",
    "general_advice": "VACTERL association (or VATER syndrome - an older acronym) is a non-random association of specific congenital malformations (birth defects) that tend to occur together more often than would be expected by chance. The acronym VACTERL stands for: V - Vertebral defects (e.g., misshapen vertebrae, hemivertebrae, scoliosis). A - Anal atresia (imperforate anus - anus not properly formed or absent). C - Cardiac (heart) defects (e.g., ventricular septal defect - VSD, atrial septal defect - ASD, tetralogy of Fallot).

R - Renal (kidney) abnormalities (e.g., absent or malformed kidneys, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux) and sometimes Radial limb abnormalities (e.g., absent or hypoplastic radius bone in forearm, thumb abnormalities). L - Limb abnormalities (other than radial, e.g., polydactyly, syndactyly - though R often covers this now). For a diagnosis of VACTERL association, a child typically needs to have at least three of these characteristic anomalies. The exact cause is unknown and likely multifactorial, possibly involving a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It's generally considered sporadic (not inherited in a simple pattern), though rare familial cases have been reported. Intellectual development is usually normal unless other associated conditions (e.g., severe hydrocephalus, chromosomal abnormalities sometimes seen with VACTERL-like features) are present.",

Types of vaginal cysts include: 1) Inclusion cysts (epidermal inclusion cysts - most common): Small, often result from trauma during childbirth (e.g., from episiotomy repair) or surgery, where a piece of vaginal lining gets trapped under the surface. 2) Gartner's duct cysts: Arise from remnants of the Wolffian duct (a structure present during fetal development that usually disappears in females). Often found on side walls of vagina. 3) Bartholin's gland cysts: Occur when the Bartholin's glands (located on either side of vaginal opening, produce lubrication) become blocked. If infected, can form a painful Bartholin's abscess (see separate entry if needed). 4) Müllerian cysts: Arise from remnants of Müllerian duct structures. Most vaginal cysts are small and asymptomatic, often found incidentally during a pelvic exam. If they grow larger or become symptomatic, they can cause: a palpable lump or bulge in the vagina, discomfort or pain (especially during intercourse or with tampon use), or difficulty inserting a tampon.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a lump or cyst in your vagina, or experience discomfort, consult your doctor or gynecologist. They can diagnose it with a pelvic exam. Usually, no further testing is needed if it appears to be a simple benign cyst. A biopsy may be done if the cyst has unusual features or if there's any concern about malignancy (very rare for vaginal cysts).",

    "emergency_advice": "While not usually an emergency, seek medical attention if: symptoms are severe (e.g., extensive redness, swelling, cracks/fissures in skin); it's your first yeast infection (to confirm diagnosis and rule out other conditions); over-the-counter (OTC) treatments are not effective or symptoms recur soon after treatment; you are pregnant; you have diabetes or a weakened immune system; or if you have recurrent infections (e.g., 4 or more in a year). Also, if there's foul-smelling discharge, fever, or pelvic pain (could be a different infection like BV or an STI).",
    "general_advice": "A vaginal yeast infection, also known as vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), is a common fungal infection that causes irritation, discharge, and intense itching of the vagina and vulva (the external female genitals). It's caused by an overgrowth of a type of yeast (fungus) called *Candida*, most commonly *Candida albicans*. A small amount of Candida normally lives in the vagina without causing problems, but certain factors can disrupt the normal vaginal balance and allow Candida to multiply, leading to infection. Common symptoms include: intense itching and irritation in the vagina and vulva; a thick, white, odorless vaginal discharge, often described as resembling cottage cheese (though discharge can sometimes be watery or absent); burning sensation, especially during intercourse or urination; redness and swelling of the vulva; and sometimes soreness or rash. Risk factors include: antibiotic use (can kill beneficial bacteria in vagina, allowing yeast overgrowth), pregnancy (hormonal changes), uncontrolled diabetes (high blood sugar can promote yeast growth), weakened immune system (e.g., HIV/AIDS, on immunosuppressants), use of hormonal contraceptives with high estrogen levels, douching or use of scented feminine products (can irritate and alter vaginal flora), wearing tight, non-breathable clothing or wet swimsuits for long periods, and sometimes stress.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect a yeast infection, especially if it's your first one, or if symptoms are severe or recurrent, see your doctor or gynecologist. They can confirm the diagnosis (usually by examining vaginal discharge under a microscope - KOH prep - for yeast, or sometimes by culture if recurrent/atypical) and rule out other conditions with similar symptoms (e.g., bacterial vaginosis - BV, trichomoniasis, contact dermatitis).",

    "severity_level": "Low",
    "emergency_advice": null,
    "general_advice": "Vaginismus is a condition characterized by involuntary muscle spasms or contractions of the muscles of the pelvic floor, particularly those surrounding the vaginal opening (pubococcygeus muscle group), whenever vaginal penetration is attempted (e.g., with sexual intercourse, tampon insertion, or during a gynecological exam). This muscle spasm makes penetration painful, difficult, or impossible, and is not due to a lack of desire or arousal. It's an involuntary reflex that the woman cannot consciously control. The fear or anticipation of pain can often worsen the spasms, creating a cycle of pain and anxiety. Vaginismus can be: 1) Primary (lifelong): Occurs from the first attempt at vaginal penetration. 2) Secondary (acquired): Develops later in life, after a period of normal, pain-free penetration, often triggered by a physical event (e.g., childbirth trauma, surgery, infection, menopause-related dryness) or psychological factors (e.g., trauma, anxiety, relationship issues, fear of pain/pregnancy). In the DSM-5, vaginismus is now included under the broader category of Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD), which also encompasses dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and other penetration difficulties. Vaginismus can cause significant distress, relationship problems, and impact quality of life and ability to conceive.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience pain, difficulty, or inability with vaginal penetration, consult your doctor or gynecologist. They can perform a pelvic exam (often very gentle, with focus on patient comfort and control) to rule out any underlying physical causes (e.g., infection, structural abnormalities, severe vaginal dryness/atrophy, skin conditions) and discuss the diagnosis. Referral to a specialist in sexual medicine, a pelvic floor physical therapist, or a sex therapist/psychotherapist may be recommended.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment for vaginismus is often very successful and usually involves a combination of approaches, focusing on addressing both physical and psychological components.",
      "  - Sex education and counseling: Understanding the condition, addressing any fears, anxieties, or misconceptions about sex and an_atomy. Couples therapy may be helpful.",
      "  - Pelvic floor physical therapy: Taught by a specialized physical therapist. Involves exercises to learn to relax and control pelvic floor muscles (e.g., reverse Kegels, diaphragmatic breathing), desensitization techniques, and sometimes use of vaginal dilators.",
      "  - Vaginal dilators (trainers): A set of smooth, tube-shaped devices of increasing size that are gradually and gently inserted into the vagina by the woman herself, in a private, relaxed setting, to help desensitize the area, stretch muscles, and overcome fear of penetration. This is often a key component of treatment.",
      "  - Relaxation techniques and mindfulness: To reduce anxiety and muscle tension.",
      "  - Topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine gel): May sometimes be used short-term to reduce pain with initial attempts at penetration or dilator use, but focus is usually on addressing muscle spasm.",

Emergency signs include: severe difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood, high fever with drenching sweats and significant weight loss, or symptoms of disseminated infection (e.g., severe headache, stiff neck, confusion - meningitis; bone pain; skin lesions that are persistent or spreading; or signs of organ involvement).",
    "general_advice": "Valley fever, also known as coccidioidomycosis, is a fungal infection caused by inhaling spores of the fungus *Coccidioides immitis* or *Coccidioides posadasii*. These fungi are found in the soil of arid and semi-arid regions, primarily in the southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Texas), as well as parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Infection occurs when soil containing the spores is disturbed (e.g., by wind, construction, farming, earthquakes) and the spores are inhaled. Most people who inhale the spores (about 60%) do not get sick or have very mild, flu-like symptoms that resolve on their own without treatment (asymptomatic or subclinical infection). When symptomatic illness (acute Valley Fever or primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis) does occur, it usually develops 1-3 weeks after exposure and can cause: fever, cough (often dry), chest pain (can be pleuritic), fatigue, headache, muscle aches, joint pain (arthralgia, sometimes with swelling - 'desert rheumatism'), night sweats, and sometimes a rash (e.g., erythema nodosum - tender red bumps on shins, or erythema multiforme). In a small percentage of infected individuals (especially those with weakened immune systems - e.g., HIV/AIDS, organ transplant, on immunosuppressants; pregnant women in third trimester; or certain ethnic groups like Filipinos, African Americans, Hispanics), the infection can become severe, chronic (chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis - can cause lung cavities), or disseminate (spread) from the lungs to other parts of the body, such as the skin, bones, joints, lymph nodes, or central nervous system (meningitis - most serious form).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you live in or have traveled to an endemic area and develop persistent flu-like or respiratory symptoms, especially with rash or joint pain, consult your doctor and inform them of your potential exposure. Diagnosis can involve chest X-ray or CT scan (may show infiltrates, nodules, cavities, or hilar lymphadenopathy), blood tests (for *Coccidioides* antibodies - IgM/IgG, or antigen tests), sputum or tissue cultures (to grow fungus), or biopsy of affected tissue.",

    "general_advice": "A varicocele is an enlargement of the veins within the pampiniform plexus, the network of veins that drain blood from the testicles, located in the scrotum above the testicles. It's similar to a varicose vein that can occur in the leg. Varicoceles are common, affecting about 15% of males, usually developing during puberty, and are more frequent on the left side (due to anatomical differences in how the left testicular vein drains). The exact cause is often related to malfunctioning valves within these veins, which normally prevent backward blood flow. When valves fail, blood can pool and cause veins to dilate (widen) and become engorged. Most varicoceles cause no symptoms and are harmless. When symptoms do occur, they can include: a dull ache, pain, or feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, especially after prolonged standing or physical exertion (often relieved by lying down); a palpable or visible mass of enlarged, twisted veins in the scrotum, sometimes described as feeling like a 'bag of worms'; and sometimes testicular atrophy (shrinkage) or impaired testicular growth on the affected side (especially if varicocele develops during adolescence). Varicoceles are also a common identifiable cause of male infertility, as the increased blood flow and temperature in the scrotum can potentially impair sperm production and quality.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you notice a lump or swelling in your scrotum, experience scrotal pain or discomfort, or have concerns about fertility, consult your doctor (primary care or urologist). Diagnosis is usually made by physical exam (palpation of scrotum, often done while standing and with Valsalva maneuver - straining, which can make varicocele more prominent). A scrotal ultrasound may be done to confirm the diagnosis, assess size, and evaluate testicles.",

    "general_advice": "Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted, bulging, often bluish or dark purple veins that are visible just under the surface of the skin, most commonly appearing on the legs and feet. They occur when faulty valves within the veins allow blood to flow backward or pool, causing the veins to stretch and dilate. Veins have one-way valves that help blood flow against gravity towards the heart. If these valves weaken or become damaged, blood can collect in the veins, increasing pressure and causing them to become varicose. Risk factors include: older age, female sex, pregnancy (hormonal changes, increased blood volume, uterine pressure on veins), family history, obesity, prolonged standing or sitting (can reduce blood flow), and sometimes previous leg DVT. Symptoms can vary: many are primarily a cosmetic concern. When symptomatic, they can cause: aching, pain, heaviness, or throbbing in the legs (often worse at end of day or after standing/sitting for long); mild swelling in ankles or feet; itching or burning sensation over veins; muscle cramps in legs (especially at night); and sometimes skin changes like discoloration (brownish pigmentation), dryness, or eczema (venous eczema/stasis dermatitis) around affected veins. Complications can include: superficial thrombophlebitis (clots in superficial varicose veins), bleeding, venous ulcers (especially near ankles), and an increased risk of DVT (though link is complex). Spider veins (telangiectasias) are smaller, finer, red/blue lines closer to skin surface, often co-exist but are a milder form of venous insufficiency.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If varicose veins are causing pain, discomfort, swelling, skin changes, or if you are concerned about their appearance, consult your doctor (primary care, vascular specialist, dermatologist, or phlebologist). They can diagnose varicose veins by physical exam and may recommend further tests (e.g., Doppler ultrasound) to assess vein function and rule out DVT if suspected.

    "general_advice": "Vasculitis is a general term for a group of rare autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessel walls. This inflammation can cause blood vessels to thicken, weaken, narrow, or scar, leading to restricted blood flow and damage to the organs and tissues supplied by those vessels. Vasculitis can affect any type of blood vessel (arteries, veins, capillaries) and any organ system. It can be primary (cause unknown, autoimmune) or secondary (triggered by an infection like hepatitis B/C, certain medications, or other autoimmune diseases like lupus/RA, or cancer).

    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent leg swelling, pain, skin changes, varicose veins, or non-healing sores on your legs/ankles, consult your doctor (primary care, vascular specialist, or dermatologist/wound care specialist). Diagnosis is often based on clinical exam. Doppler ultrasound is commonly used to assess blood flow in leg veins and identify valve dysfunction or blockages (like DVT).",

    "emergency_advice": "Symptoms of VBI, especially if sudden, recurrent, or crescendo (increasing in frequency/severity), can be a warning sign of an impending stroke in the posterior circulation (brainstem, cerebellum, occipital lobes) or can represent a TIA. Seek immediate emergency medical attention for: sudden onset of dizziness or vertigo (often with nausea/vomiting), double vision (diplopia) or other vision changes (e.g., blurred vision, partial blindness), slurred speech (dysarthria), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), ataxia (unsteadiness, poor coordination, difficulty walking), numbness or weakness (especially if one-sided or involving face/limbs), drop attacks (sudden leg weakness causing falls without loss of consciousness), confusion, or altered level of consciousness. These are stroke/TIA symptoms.",
    "general_advice": "Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) refers to reduced blood flow to the posterior (back) part of the brain, which is supplied by the two vertebral arteries and the basilar artery (formed by the joining of vertebral arteries). This area includes the brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and occipital/temporal lobes. Insufficient blood flow can lead to transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes. The most common cause of VBI is atherosclerosis (plaque buildup) in the vertebral or basilar arteries, causing narrowing (stenosis) or blockage. Other less common causes include: arterial dissection (tear in artery wall), vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia, subclavian steal syndrome (blood flow to arm 'steals' from vertebral artery), or cervical spine abnormalities/trauma that compress vertebral arteries (e.g., with certain head movements - rotational VBI or Bow Hunter's syndrome). Symptoms are often transient and can be triggered by head movements or changes in posture. They reflect dysfunction in the brain areas supplied by these arteries (see emergency advice for common symptoms).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience recurrent episodes of dizziness, vertigo, vision changes, or other neurological symptoms suggestive of VBI, consult your doctor (primary care or neurologist/stroke specialist) promptly. If symptoms are acute and stroke-like, it's an emergency.

Recurrent febrile UTIs in infants/young children always warrant prompt evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a condition in which urine flows backward (refluxes) from the bladder up into one or both ureters (the tubes that carry urine from kidneys to bladder) and sometimes into the kidneys. Normally, a one-way valve mechanism at the ureterovesical junction (where ureter enters bladder) prevents this backflow. VUR occurs when this valve is incompetent. It's most commonly diagnosed in infants and young children, often after a urinary tract infection (UTI). VUR can be: 1) Primary VUR (most common): Due to a congenital (present at birth) abnormality in the development of the ureterovesical junction. Often resolves spontaneously as child grows and ureter lengthens/matures. 2) Secondary VUR: Caused by an acquired problem that increases bladder pressure or obstructs bladder outlet, forcing urine backward (e.g., posterior urethral valves in boys - see separate entry, neurogenic bladder, recurrent bladder infections causing inflammation). The main concern with VUR is that it increases the risk of bacteria from the bladder reaching the kidneys, leading to pyelonephritis (kidney infection), which can cause kidney scarring (renal scarring) and, over time, potentially lead to high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease/failure if severe or recurrent. VUR is graded from I (mildest) to V (most severe). Many children with low-grade VUR have no symptoms other than recurrent UTIs (fever, painful/frequent urination, urgency, foul-smelling urine, abdominal/flank pain).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If a child has recurrent UTIs (especially febrile UTIs), or if prenatal ultrasound showed hydronephrosis, VUR may be suspected. Consult a pediatrician or pediatric urologist/nephrologist. Diagnosis is made with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG - X-ray taken while bladder is filled with contrast and during urination, to visualize reflux) and renal ultrasound (to assess kidneys for hydronephrosis/scarring). A DMSA scan (nuclear medicine) can assess for renal scarring.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends on the child's age, grade of reflux, frequency/severity of UTIs, presence of renal scarring, and whether VUR is unilateral or bilateral. It's guided by a pediatric urologist/nephrologist.",
      "  - Observation ('watchful waiting'): For low-grade VUR (I-II, sometimes III) with infrequent or no UTIs, as many cases resolve spontaneously with age. Regular monitoring (ultrasound, VCUG, urine tests) is done.",
      "  - Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP): Low daily dose of antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent UTIs while awaiting spontaneous resolution of VUR, especially if recurrent febrile UTIs or higher grades.",
      "  - Prompt treatment of any breakthrough UTIs with appropriate antibiotics.",
      "  - Bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) management: If present (e.g., constipation, dysfunctional voiding habits), addressing these issues (e.g., timed voiding, constipation management, biofeedback) can be very important, as BBD can worsen VUR or UTI risk.",
      "  - Surgical correction (ureteral reimplantation): May be considered for high-grade VUR (IV-V), VUR that doesn't resolve with age, breakthrough febrile UTIs despite CAP, or progressive renal scarring. Surgery aims to correct the faulty valve mechanism by re-implanting the ureter into the bladder in a way that prevents reflux. Can be done open or endoscopically (e.g., Deflux injection - injecting a bulking agent near ureteral opening, less invasive but may be less durable).",
      "Good hygiene practices to prevent UTIs (e.g., proper wiping, adequate fluid intake, regular voiding).",

    "general_advice": "A viral exanthem is a widespread skin rash caused by a viral infection. It's very common, especially in children. The rash is often a manifestation of the body's immune response to the virus. Many different viruses can cause exanthems, and the appearance of the rash can vary (e.g., maculopapular - flat red spots with small raised bumps, vesicular - small fluid-filled blisters, morbilliform - measles-like). The rash is often accompanied by other symptoms of viral illness, such as fever, fatigue, malaise, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, cough, or runny nose. Examples of common viral illnesses that cause exanthems include: Measles (rubeola), Rubella (German measles), Chickenpox (varicella - vesicular rash), Fifth disease (erythema infectiosum - caused by parvovirus B19, 'slapped cheek' rash then lacy rash on body), Roseola infantum (exanthem subitum - caused by HHV-6/7, high fever followed by rash as fever breaks), Hand, foot, and mouth disease (caused by coxsackievirus/enterovirus - vesicular rash on hands/feet/mouth), Mononucleosis (EBV - can sometimes cause a rash, especially if amoxicillin given), and many non-specific viral infections (e.g., from enteroviruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses - often just described as 'viral rash').",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child develops a widespread rash, especially if accompanied by fever or other systemic symptoms, consult a doctor. While many are benign, it's important to rule out more serious conditions or specific viral illnesses that may require public health measures (like measles) or have potential complications (like chickenpox in certain individuals).

These viruses differ in their modes of transmission, clinical course, severity, and potential for chronic infection and long-term complications. Acute viral hepatitis can cause symptoms like: fatigue, malaise, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort (often upper right quadrant), dark urine, pale stools, joint pain, and jaundice. However, many acute infections (especially HAV in children, and often HBV/HCV) can be asymptomatic or cause only mild, non-specific symptoms.

For genital warts, always see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.",
    "general_advice": "Viral warts are common, benign (non-cancerous) skin growths caused by infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different HPV types, and they tend to infect specific skin or mucosal surfaces. Warts are contagious and can spread by direct skin-to-skin contact with a wart or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus (e.g., shower floors, towels). Autoinoculation (spreading to other parts of one's own body) is also common. Types of warts include: 1) Common warts (verruca vulgaris): Rough, raised, flesh-colored or grayish-brown bumps, often on hands, fingers, around nails, sometimes elbows/knees. May have tiny black dots (clotted blood vessels). 2) Plantar warts (verruca plantaris): Occur on soles of feet. Can be painful due to pressure from walking, often grow inward, may have a rough surface with black dots, and can occur in clusters (mosaic warts). 3) Flat warts (verruca plana): Small, smooth, flat-topped, flesh-colored or slightly pink/brown papules, often occur in multiples on face, neck, hands, wrists, knees. Common in children/young adults. 4) Genital warts (condyloma acuminata - see HPV entry): Caused by specific HPV types, appear on genitals, anal area, or sometimes mouth/throat. Sexually transmitted. Always require medical evaluation. 5) Filiform warts: Long, narrow, finger-like projections, often on face, neck, eyelids, lips.",

    "general_advice": "Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) occurs when the body does not have enough vitamin A, an essential fat-soluble vitamin crucial for vision (especially night vision and corneal health), immune function, cell growth and differentiation, reproduction, and skin health. VAD is a major public health problem in many developing countries, particularly affecting young children and pregnant women, often due to inadequate dietary intake of vitamin A or preformed vitamin A (retinol) and provitamin A carotenoids (like beta-carotene, found in plants, which body converts to vitamin A). In developed countries, VAD is less common but can occur in individuals with: very restrictive diets, malabsorption syndromes (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, chronic liver disease, bariatric surgery), or alcoholism. Symptoms progress with severity of deficiency: Early sign is often night blindness (nyctalopia - difficulty seeing in low light). Xerophthalmia (dry eyes) follows, with Bitot's spots, corneal xerosis (drying), corneal ulceration, and eventually keratomalacia (softening/melting of cornea), leading to blindness.

    "general_advice": "Vitamin D deficiency occurs when the body does not have enough vitamin D, an essential fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphorus absorption, bone health (preventing rickets in children and osteomalacia/osteoporosis in adults), immune function, muscle function, and cell growth. The body produces vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight (UVB radiation). It's also found in some foods (e.g., fatty fish like salmon/mackerel/sardines, fish liver oils, egg yolks, fortified foods like milk/yogurt/orange juice/cereals) and can be taken as a supplement. Deficiency is very common worldwide. Risk factors include: inadequate sun exposure (e.g., living in northern latitudes, extensive sunscreen use, covering skin, being housebound), darker skin pigmentation (melanin acts as natural sunscreen), older age (skin produces less vitamin D, kidneys less efficient at activating it), obesity (vitamin D can get sequestered in fat tissue), malabsorption syndromes (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's, cystic fibrosis, bariatric surgery), chronic kidney or liver disease (impair vitamin D activation), certain medications (e.g., some anticonvulsants, corticosteroids), and exclusively breastfeeding infants without vitamin D supplementation (breast milk is low in vitamin D). Most people with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency are asymptomatic. If symptoms do occur (often with more severe or prolonged deficiency), they can be vague and include: fatigue, bone pain or tenderness (especially in lower back, pelvis, hips, legs), muscle weakness or aches, mood changes (e.g., depression), impaired wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections. In children, severe deficiency causes rickets (soft, weak, deformed bones). In adults, it causes osteomalacia (softening of bones) and contributes to osteoporosis (low bone density, increased fracture risk).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency or have significant risk factors, consult your doctor. They may recommend a blood test to measure your vitamin D level (25-hydroxyvitamin D - 25(OH)D). Screening for general population is controversial, but often done for at-risk groups. If deficient, your doctor will recommend supplementation.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Treatment involves vitamin D supplementation to bring levels back to normal. Dosing depends on severity of deficiency and individual factors, and is guided by your doctor.",
      "  - Vitamin D supplements: Usually vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is preferred over D2 (ergocalciferol). Available in various doses (tablets, capsules, liquids, drops). High doses may be given initially for repletion, followed by a lower maintenance dose.",
      "  - Sunlight exposure: Sensible sun exposure (e.g., 10-30 minutes of midday sun on arms/legs, a few times a week, without sunscreen - depending on skin type, location, time of year) can help body produce vitamin D, but balance with skin cancer risk (avoid sunburn).",
      "  - Dietary sources: Include vitamin D-rich foods, though it can be difficult to get enough from diet alone.",
      "Ensure adequate calcium intake as well, as vitamin D and calcium work together for bone health.",
      "Follow your doctor's recommendations for supplementation dosage and duration. Re-testing of vitamin D levels is usually done after a few months of treatment to ensure levels are adequate and not too high (vitamin D toxicity is rare but possible with very high supplement doses).",
      "For infants (especially breastfed), American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 400 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation starting shortly after birth.",
      "Manage underlying conditions that may contribute to deficiency."

    "display_name": "Vitreous Degeneration / Syneresis / Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)",
    "severity_level": "Low",
    "emergency_advice": "Seek immediate medical attention from an ophthalmologist if the onset of new floaters or flashes of light is sudden, significantly increased in number/intensity, or accompanied by any loss of peripheral (side) vision or a curtain-like shadow over your vision. These could be signs of a retinal tear or retinal detachment, which are serious complications that can occur during or after a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and require urgent treatment to prevent vision loss.",
    "general_advice": "Vitreous degeneration, also known as vitreous syneresis, is a common, age-related process where the vitreous humor, the clear, gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye (vitreous cavity) behind the lens, gradually liquefies and shrinks. As the vitreous liquefies, small collagen fibers within it can clump together, forming opacities that cast shadows on the retina. These are perceived as eye floaters (see Floaters entry - specks, spots, cobwebs drifting in vision). Eventually, the shrinking vitreous gel can pull away from the retina at the back of the eye, a process called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD is a very common event, typically occurring in people over 50 (earlier in myopic/nearsighted individuals or after eye trauma/surgery). When PVD occurs, it often causes a sudden onset or increase in floaters, and sometimes flashes of light (photopsia - due to vitreous pulling on retina). In most cases, PVD is a benign event and does not cause long-term vision problems, though the floaters can be annoying. However, in a small percentage of cases (about 10-15%), the vitreous pulling on the retina during PVD can cause a retinal tear. If a retinal tear is not treated, fluid can seep under the retina through the tear, leading to a retinal detachment, which can cause severe vision loss.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Any new onset of floaters or flashes of light, or a sudden increase in them, should be evaluated promptly by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) with a dilated eye exam. This is to rule out a retinal tear or detachment. If a tear is found, laser treatment or cryotherapy can often be done to seal it and prevent detachment. If a detachment has occurred, surgical repair is needed.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "If PVD is diagnosed and no retinal tear/detachment is present:",
      "  - Floaters are usually harmless and may become less noticeable over time as the brain learns to ignore them or as they settle out of the line of sight. There is generally no specific treatment needed for benign floaters unless they are extremely debilitating (see Floaters entry for rare treatment options).",
      "  - Flashes of light usually subside within a few days to weeks as the vitreous completely separates.",
      "  - Be aware of the warning signs of retinal tear/detachment (sudden increase in floaters, new flashes, peripheral vision loss, curtain/shadow) and report them immediately to your eye doctor if they occur, even months after initial PVD.",

A vitreous hemorrhage can be a sign of a serious underlying eye condition that may be sight-threatening if not promptly evaluated and managed.",
    "general_advice": "A vitreous hemorrhage is bleeding into the vitreous humor, the clear, gel-like substance that fills the vitreous cavity (the large space behind the lens and in front of the retina) of the eye. Blood in the vitreous can obstruct light from reaching the retina, leading to impaired vision. The severity of vision loss depends on the amount of bleeding. Causes of vitreous hemorrhage are diverse and can include: 1) Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR - most common cause in adults): Abnormal new blood vessels on the retina (neovascularization) due to diabetes are fragile and can bleed into the vitreous. 2) Retinal tear or detachment: Tearing of a retinal blood vessel during a retinal tear or detachment. 3) Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD): When the vitreous gel pulls away from the retina, it can sometimes tear a small retinal blood vessel. 4) Retinal vein occlusion (RVO): Blockage of a retinal vein can lead to bleeding. 5) Age-related macular degeneration (AMD - wet form): Abnormal blood vessels under macula can bleed into vitreous. 6) Trauma to the eye. 7) Sickle cell retinopathy or other blood disorders. 8) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (Terson's syndrome - rare, vitreous hemorrhage associated with SAH). Symptoms include sudden onset of floaters (can be numerous, stringy, or like a 'swarm of bees'), hazy or cloudy vision, blurred vision, shadows or cobwebs in vision, a reddish tint to vision, or significant vision loss. Flashes of light may precede or accompany it if related to retinal tear/detachment. It's usually painless.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Immediate ophthalmological evaluation is crucial. Diagnosis involves a dilated eye exam to visualize the retina and identify the source of bleeding. B-scan ultrasound of the eye is often needed if the view of the retina is obscured by blood. Further tests (e.g., fluorescein angiography, OCT) may be done depending on suspected cause.",

Also, if hoarseness is rapidly worsening or associated with coughing up blood or unexplained weight loss (to rule out malignancy, though polyps are usually benign).",
    "general_advice": "A vocal cord polyp is a benign (non-cancerous), usually unilateral (affecting one vocal cord) growth that typically appears as a soft, swollen, fluid-filled or blister-like lesion on the edge of a vocal cord. Polyps can vary in size and shape (can be sessile - broad-based, or pedunculated - on a stalk). They often result from vocal abuse or misuse, such as excessive or improper voice use (e.g., yelling, cheering, prolonged loud talking or singing), or sometimes from a single episode of acute vocal trauma (e.g., screaming). Chronic irritation from factors like smoking, allergies, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can also contribute. The main symptom is hoarseness or a breathy, raspy, or rough voice quality. Other symptoms can include: vocal fatigue (voice tires easily), decreased pitch range, voice breaks, a feeling of a lump in the throat, or frequent throat clearing. Unlike nodules (which are usually bilateral and like calluses), polyps are more like blisters or localized swellings.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent hoarseness (lasting more than 2-3 weeks), voice changes, or other vocal symptoms, consult your doctor or an ENT specialist (otolaryngologist), preferably one with expertise in voice disorders (laryngologist). Diagnosis involves a medical history (including voice use habits) and visualization of the vocal cords using laryngoscopy (e.g., indirect mirror laryngoscopy, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, or rigid videostroboscopy - which allows assessment of vocal cord vibration).",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends on the size of the polyp, severity of symptoms, and patient's vocal needs.",
      "  - Voice rest and vocal hygiene: This is often the first step. Avoid talking, whispering, shouting, singing, and throat clearing as much as possible to allow vocal cords to rest. Stay well-hydrated. Avoid irritants like smoke and alcohol. Manage GERD if present.",
      "  - Voice therapy: With a speech-language pathologist specializing in voice. Involves learning proper voice use techniques, reducing vocal strain, and improving vocal hygiene. Can be very effective, especially for smaller polyps or as an adjunct to other treatments.",
      "  - Treatment of underlying contributing factors (e.g., GERD, allergies, smoking cessation).",
      "  - Surgical removal (microlaryngoscopy with phonomicrosurgery): If the polyp is large, persistent despite conservative measures, or significantly impacting voice quality, surgical excision may be recommended.

Delay in treatment can lead to bowel gangrene, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, and death.",
    "general_advice": "A volvulus is a condition where a loop of intestine twists around itself and the mesentery (the tissue that supports it and contains its blood vessels), causing a bowel obstruction and potentially cutting off blood supply to the twisted segment (strangulation). This can lead to ischemia (lack of oxygen), necrosis (tissue death), and perforation if not corrected quickly. Volvulus can occur in different parts of the intestine: 1) Sigmoid volvulus: Most common type in adults, especially elderly or debilitated individuals, often associated with chronic constipation, high-fiber diet (in some populations), or institutionalization. The sigmoid colon (S-shaped part of lower colon) is redundant and mobile, predisposing it to twisting. 2) Cecal volvulus: Less common, often in younger to middle-aged adults, involves twisting of the cecum (beginning of large intestine) and sometimes terminal ileum. May be related to abnormal intestinal fixation. 3) Midgut volvulus: Most common in infants and young children, often associated with malrotation of the intestine (a congenital abnormality where intestines don't settle into their normal position during fetal development). This is a surgical emergency in newborns. 4) Gastric volvulus (stomach twists on itself - rare). Symptoms vary by location and severity but typically include acute abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and constipation/obstipation (see emergency advice).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "Go to an emergency department immediately if volvulus is suspected. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, abdominal X-rays (may show characteristic signs like 'coffee bean' sign for sigmoid volvulus, or dilated loops of bowel), and often a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis (can confirm diagnosis, show location of twist, assess for ischemia, and identify cause). A contrast enema may be used for sigmoid volvulus diagnosis and sometimes for non-surgical detorsion.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Self-care is NOT for managing an acute volvulus; it requires urgent hospital care and often surgery.",
      "Treatment aims to untwist (detorse) the bowel, restore blood flow, and prevent recurrence.",
      "  - For sigmoid volvulus: Sometimes non-surgical detorsion can be attempted via sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (passing a scope to untwist the loop and decompress it with a rectal tube). However, recurrence is common, so elective surgical resection of the sigmoid colon is often recommended after successful detorsion to prevent it.",
      "  - For cecal volvulus and midgut volvulus: Usually require emergency surgery to untwist the bowel, assess its viability, resect any necrotic segment, and often perform procedures to fix the bowel in place to prevent recurrence (e.g., cecopexy for cecal volvulus, Ladd's procedure for malrotation/midgut volvulus).",
      "  - Supportive care includes: Bowel rest (NPO), IV fluids, NG tube for decompression, antibiotics.",
      "If bowel is gangrenous, resection is necessary, and an ostomy (colostomy or ileostomy) may be created temporarily or permanently.",

    "general_advice": "Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. It's caused by a deficiency or defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF), a blood protein that plays a crucial role in blood clotting (hemostasis). vWF helps platelets stick to blood vessel walls at sites of injury (platelet adhesion) and also carries and protects clotting factor VIII (FVIII - the factor deficient in hemophilia A). There are three main types of vWD, with varying severity: 1) Type 1 vWD (most common, ~75%): Mild to moderate quantitative deficiency of vWF (lower than normal levels of structurally normal vWF). Symptoms are usually mild (e.g., easy bruising, nosebleeds, gum bleeding, prolonged bleeding from minor cuts, heavy menstrual periods). 2) Type 2 vWD (~20-25%): Qualitative defect in vWF (vWF is present but doesn't function properly). Has several subtypes (2A, 2B, 2M, 2N) with different functional defects and bleeding patterns. Can be mild to moderate. 3) Type 3 vWD (rare, most severe): Severe quantitative deficiency of vWF (very little or no vWF produced), leading to very low FVIII levels as well. Symptoms are severe and can include spontaneous bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis) and muscles, similar to moderate/severe hemophilia. vWD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (Type 1, most Type 2) or autosomal recessive pattern (Type 3, some Type 2). Acquired vWD can also occur (rarely) due to other medical conditions or medications.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child experiences frequent or prolonged bleeding, easy bruising, heavy menstrual periods, or if there's a family history of a bleeding disorder, consult your doctor (primary care or hematologist). Diagnosis involves a panel of blood tests to measure vWF antigen levels, vWF activity (e.g., ristocetin cofactor activity - vWF:RCo), FVIII levels, and sometimes vWF multimer analysis or genetic testing to determine type/subtype.",

Most vulvar cancers (about 90%) are squamous cell carcinomas, arising from skin cells. Other rarer types include melanoma of the vulva, adenocarcinoma (e.g., from Bartholin's glands), sarcoma, or basal cell carcinoma. Vulvar cancer often develops slowly over many years, sometimes preceded by precancerous changes called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). Symptoms can include: persistent itching, pain, or tenderness in the vulvar area; a lump, bump, or wart-like growth on the vulva; thickened, raised, or discolored (red, white, or dark) patches of skin on the vulva; an open sore or ulcer that doesn't heal (especially if it bleeds); abnormal bleeding or discharge not related to menstruation; or pain during urination or intercourse. Risk factors include: older age (most common after 65), infection with certain high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV - associated with many squamous cell vulvar cancers, especially in younger women), history of VIN, lichen sclerosus (a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting vulva), smoking, weakened immune system (e.g., HIV), and history of other genital cancers (e.g., cervical cancer).",

Not all three are always present. Any new, acute neurological or mental status changes in an at-risk individual warrant urgent care.",
    "general_advice": "Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a severe neurological disorder caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). It typically occurs in two stages, though they can overlap or Korsakoff can develop without a clearly recognized Wernicke's phase: 1) Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE): An acute, life-threatening but potentially reversible brain disorder characterized by the classic triad of confusion/altered mental status (disorientation, apathy, inattention), ophthalmoplegia (eye movement abnormalities like nystagmus, palsies of eye muscles, ptosis), and ataxia (unsteady gait, difficulty with coordination). Other symptoms can include drowsiness, stupor, or coma. If not treated promptly and adequately with thiamine, WE can lead to permanent brain damage or death, or progress to Korsakoff syndrome. 2) Korsakoff syndrome (KS, Korsakoff's psychosis): A chronic, often irreversible neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by severe anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories) and retrograde amnesia (loss of some past memories), confabulation (making up stories to fill memory gaps, not intentionally lying), apathy, lack of insight, and sometimes disorientation. Other cognitive functions may be relatively preserved. The most common cause of WKS is chronic alcohol abuse, which leads to thiamine deficiency through poor diet, impaired thiamine absorption/storage, and increased thiamine requirements. Other causes of severe thiamine deficiency leading to WKS include: severe malnutrition (e.g., from starvation, eating disorders, poverty), prolonged vomiting (e.g., hyperemesis gravidarum), bariatric surgery (if thiamine not supplemented), certain cancers, chemotherapy, dialysis, or critical illness.",

Seek immediate medical attention for: signs of severe, uncontrolled infection (high fever, chills, sepsis - if neutropenia or functional WBC defect); acute complications of leukemia or lymphoma (see separate entries - e.g., bleeding, severe anemia, tumor lysis syndrome, critical organ compression); or severe allergic/hypersensitivity reaction if eosinophilic disorder is involved and triggered. Any sudden, severe illness in someone with a known WBC disorder warrants urgent care.",
    "general_advice": "White blood cell (WBC) disorder is a very broad term for any condition that affects the number or function of white blood cells (leukocytes), which are a crucial part of the immune system, defending the body against infection and disease. WBCs are produced in the bone marrow. There are several types of WBCs, including neutrophils, lymphocytes (B-cells, T-cells, NK cells), monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Disorders can involve: 1) Too few WBCs (Leukopenia): Neutropenia (low neutrophils - most common, increases risk of bacterial/fungal infections), Lymphopenia (low lymphocytes - increases risk of viral/fungal/parasitic infections, can be seen in HIV/AIDS, immunosuppression, some genetic disorders). Causes of leukopenia can be bone marrow problems (e.g., aplastic anemia, leukemia, MDS, chemotherapy/radiation, vitamin deficiencies), infections (some viral), autoimmune diseases, or certain medications. 2) Too many WBCs (Leukocytosis): Neutrophilia (high neutrophils - often due to infection, inflammation, stress, steroids, CML), Lymphocytosis (high lymphocytes - often due to viral infections like mono, CLL, ALL), Eosinophilia (high eosinophils - allergies, asthma, parasitic infections, certain skin diseases, eosinophilic disorders, some cancers), Monocytosis, Basophilia. Can be reactive (normal response to stimulus) or neoplastic (due to blood cancers like leukemia/lymphoma). 3) Functional WBC disorders: WBCs are present in normal or even high numbers but do not function properly, leading to impaired immunity (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease - CGD, leukocyte adhesion deficiency - LAD, Chédiak-Higashi syndrome - these are rare genetic disorders). Symptoms vary greatly depending on the specific disorder, type of WBC affected, and whether count is too high or too low, or function is impaired. Common signs can include recurrent or severe infections (if low or dysfunctional WBCs), fatigue, fever, easy bruising/bleeding (if platelets also affected, e.g., in leukemia), bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, or symptoms related to specific leukemias/lymphomas.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you have persistent symptoms like frequent/severe infections, unexplained fatigue, fever, bruising/bleeding, or swollen lymph nodes, or if a routine blood test (CBC with differential) shows abnormal WBC counts, consult your doctor (primary care or hematologist/oncologist/immunologist).

    "display_name": "Whooping Cough (Pertussis)",
    "severity_level": "High",
    "emergency_advice": "Whooping cough can be life-threatening, especially in infants under 6 months old. Seek immediate medical attention for an infant or child (or adult with severe symptoms) if they have: severe coughing spells that cause difficulty breathing, gasping for air, or turning blue/purple (cyanosis); vomiting after coughing spells (post-tussive emesis); periods of apnea (stopped breathing, especially in infants); extreme fatigue or lethargy; or signs of dehydration due to poor feeding/vomiting. Hospitalization is often needed for infants and those with severe disease.",
    "general_advice": "Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by the bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*. It's characterized by severe, uncontrollable coughing fits, often ending with a high-pitched 'whoop' sound as the person gasps for air (though the 'whoop' may not be present, especially in infants or adults). The illness typically occurs in stages: 1) Catarrhal stage (1-2 weeks): Starts like a common cold with runny nose, low-grade fever, mild cough, and sometimes sneezing or watery eyes. Highly contagious during this stage. 2) Paroxysmal stage (1-6 weeks, can last up to 10 weeks): Cough becomes much more severe, occurring in violent, uncontrollable spasms (paroxysms), often many coughs in a row without a breath in between. Can cause vomiting after coughing, exhaustion, and the characteristic 'whoop.' Thick mucus may be expelled. 3) Convalescent stage (weeks to months): Cough gradually lessens in severity and frequency, but paroxysms can recur with subsequent respiratory infections. Pertussis can affect people of all ages, but is most dangerous for infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated, as they are at high risk for severe complications like pneumonia, seizures, brain damage (encephalopathy), apnea, and death. Immunity from childhood vaccination wanes over time, so adolescents and adults can also get pertussis and can transmit it to vulnerable infants.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you or your child has a persistent, severe cough, especially if it occurs in fits or is followed by a 'whoop' sound or vomiting, consult your doctor. Diagnosis is often clinical, especially during an outbreak. A nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate can be tested for *B. pertussis* by culture or PCR (most sensitive, especially early in illness). Blood tests for antibodies may be used later. Early treatment with antibiotics is important to reduce severity, prevent spread, and reduce risk of complications (though antibiotics may not significantly alter course of illness if started late in paroxysmal stage).",

      "Prophylactic antibiotics may also be recommended for close contacts (e.g., household members, childcare contacts) to prevent them from getting sick, especially if there are vulnerable infants or high-risk individuals in the household.",
      "Supportive care (especially for infants/young children, may require hospitalization):",
      "  - Keep home environment calm and free of irritants that can trigger coughing (smoke, dust, fumes).",
      "  - Encourage small, frequent meals and fluids to prevent dehydration and vomiting.",
      "  - Use a cool-mist humidifier to soothe airways.",
      "  - Monitor for signs of breathing difficulty or complications.",
      "  - Oxygen therapy or respiratory support if needed in hospital.",
      "Prevention is key:",
      "  - Vaccination: Pertussis vaccine is part of routine childhood immunizations (DTaP - diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis). Booster doses (Tdap) are recommended for preteens/adolescents and adults (including a dose during each pregnancy for women, to protect newborn). Ensure all family members and caregivers of infants are up to date with Tdap.",

Untreated Wilson's disease is fatal.",
    "general_advice": "Wilson's disease is a rare inherited (autosomal recessive) genetic disorder that causes an excessive accumulation of copper in the body, primarily in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. It's caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for a protein that helps transport copper out of liver cells into bile (for excretion) and incorporate it into ceruloplasmin (a copper-carrying protein in blood). When this protein doesn't function properly, copper builds up to toxic levels, causing tissue damage. Symptoms usually begin between ages 5 and 35, but can range from early childhood to older adulthood. Manifestations vary widely: 1) Liver disease: Can range from asymptomatic elevated liver enzymes to acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or acute liver failure. Symptoms may include fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, ascites, edema, easy bruising/bleeding. 2) Neurological symptoms: Due to copper deposition in brain (especially basal ganglia). Can include tremor (often a 'wing-beating' tremor of arms), dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal postures/movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia, gait problems), clumsiness, incoordination (ataxia), drooling, and changes in handwriting. 3) Psychiatric symptoms: Personality changes, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, cognitive impairment. 4) Eye manifestation: Kayser-Fleischer rings - golden-brown or greenish rings around the edge of the cornea (where iris meets sclera), due to copper deposits. Visible on slit-lamp exam, sometimes to naked eye. Not always present, especially in early liver disease. 5) Other potential problems: Hemolytic anemia, kidney stones or kidney dysfunction, bone/joint problems (arthritis, osteoporosis), heart problems (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias), or hormonal issues.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If there is a family history of Wilson's disease, or if a child or adult develops unexplained liver disease, neurological or psychiatric symptoms (especially with movement disorders or personality changes), or Kayser-Fleischer rings, consult a doctor (pediatrician, primary care, gastroenterologist/hepatologist, neurologist, or geneticist). Early diagnosis and lifelong treatment are crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage. Diagnosis involves blood tests (serum ceruloplasmin - usually low, serum copper - can be low, normal, or high), 24-hour urine copper excretion (usually high), liver biopsy (to measure copper content and assess liver damage), eye exam (for Kayser-Fleischer rings), and genetic testing for ATP7B mutations.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Wilson's disease requires lifelong medical treatment to remove excess copper and prevent re-accumulation. It's managed by specialists.",
      "  - Chelating agents: Medications that bind to copper and promote its excretion in urine. Common initial treatment drugs include D-penicillamine or trientine. These can have side effects and require careful monitoring.",
      "  - Zinc salts (e.g., zinc acetate, zinc sulfate): Used for maintenance therapy after initial chelation, or sometimes as initial treatment in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals. Zinc blocks copper absorption from the gut.",
      "  - Dietary modifications: Avoid or limit foods very high in copper, such as liver, shellfish (oysters, lobster), nuts (cashews, Brazil nuts), chocolate, mushrooms, and dried fruits. However, diet alone is not sufficient to control copper levels; medication is essential. Avoid copper-containing supplements or vitamin/mineral preparations. Check if drinking water has high copper content (e.g., from copper pipes - let water run before using).",
      "  - Liver transplant: May be necessary for acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease/cirrhosis unresponsive to medical therapy. Transplant also corrects the underlying metabolic defect.",

Also, severe oral thrush causing inability to eat/drink needs care.",
    "general_advice": "Yeast infection, or candidiasis, is a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of a type of yeast (fungus) called *Candida*, most commonly *Candida albicans*. Candida normally lives in small amounts on the skin, in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina without causing problems. However, certain factors can disrupt the normal balance of microorganisms or weaken the immune system, allowing Candida to multiply excessively and cause infection. Common types of yeast infections include: 1) Oral thrush (Oral candidiasis - see separate entry): White patches in mouth, soreness. 2) Vaginal yeast infection (Vulvovaginal candidiasis - see separate entry): Itching, irritation, thick white discharge. 3) Cutaneous candidiasis (Skin): Affects skin folds (intertrigo - see separate entry, e.g., armpits, groin, under breasts, diaper area - diaper candidiasis) causing red, itchy rash, sometimes with satellite pustules. Can also affect nail folds (paronychia) or nails (onychomycosis - less common for Candida alone). 4) Invasive candidiasis (Systemic): Rare but serious, occurs when Candida enters bloodstream and spreads to internal organs (e.g., heart, brain, eyes, bones, kidneys). Usually affects hospitalized, critically ill, or severely immunocompromised individuals. Risk factors for yeast infections include: antibiotic use, corticosteroid use (oral or inhaled), weakened immune system, diabetes (especially poorly controlled), pregnancy, hormonal contraceptives with high estrogen, obesity, warm/moist environments, wearing tight/non-breathable clothing, poor hygiene (or sometimes over-cleansing with harsh products), and denture wear (for oral thrush).",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you suspect a yeast infection, consult your doctor or dermatologist/gynecologist, especially if it's your first time, if symptoms are severe, recurrent, or don't improve with over-the-counter (OTC) treatments, or if you have underlying risk factors.

    "emergency_advice": "While Zenker's diverticulum itself usually develops slowly, seek immediate medical attention for acute complications: aspiration pneumonia (cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, after regurgitating food/fluid into lungs); complete esophageal obstruction (inability to swallow anything, including saliva); or rarely, perforation of the diverticulum (severe neck/chest pain, fever, difficulty breathing - a surgical emergency). Significant malnutrition or weight loss due to swallowing difficulties also needs urgent evaluation.",
    "general_advice": "A Zenker's diverticulum is a rare type of outpouching (diverticulum) that forms in the pharynx (throat), just above the upper esophageal sphincter (UES - the muscle at the top of the esophagus that relaxes to allow swallowing). It occurs in an area of natural muscular weakness called Killian's triangle. It's considered a 'false' diverticulum as it involves only the mucosal and submucosal layers protruding through the muscle layer. Zenker's diverticulum is thought to develop due to increased pressure in the pharynx, often related to impaired relaxation or spasm of the UES (cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction) and/or discoordination of swallowing. This pressure causes the pharyngeal lining to bulge outwards over time, forming a pouch. It typically affects older adults (usually over 60-70). As the pouch enlarges, food and liquids can get trapped in it. Symptoms often develop gradually and can include: dysphagia (difficulty swallowing, often with a sensation of food sticking in the throat, especially solids), regurgitation of undigested food (sometimes hours after eating, or when lying down/bending over), coughing or choking spells (especially after swallowing or when lying down, due to aspiration of pouch contents), halitosis (bad breath from retained food), gurgling noises in the neck, unexplained weight loss or malnutrition, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. A palpable neck mass is rare.",
    "when_to_see_doctor": "If you experience persistent difficulty swallowing, regurgitation of food, or other symptoms suggestive of a Zenker's diverticulum, consult your doctor (primary care or ENT specialist/gastroenterologist). Diagnosis is usually made with a barium swallow X-ray (esophagram), which can clearly visualize the pouch. Upper GI endoscopy may also be done (with caution, as scope can inadvertently enter diverticulum and cause perforation). Esophageal manometry may assess UES function.",
    "self_care_tips": [
      "Management depends on the size of the diverticulum and severity of symptoms.",
      "  - For small, asymptomatic diverticula found incidentally: No specific treatment may be needed other than observation.",
      "  - For symptomatic diverticula: Treatment is usually surgical or endoscopic to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.",
      "    - Endoscopic techniques (minimally invasive, often preferred for smaller diverticula or older/frailer patients): e.g., endoscopic diverticulotomy or diverticulostomy (using a stapler or laser to cut the common wall between the diverticulum and esophagus, effectively incorporating pouch into esophagus and often cutting cricopharyngeus muscle - cricopharyngeal myotomy). Done via a scope through mouth.",
      "    - Open surgical repair (less common now for primary treatment, may be needed for very large or recurrent diverticula): Involves a neck incision to either remove the diverticulum (diverticulectomy) or suspend it (diverticulopexy), often combined with a cricopharyngeal myotomy (cutting the UES muscle to relieve pressure).",
      "Dietary and behavioral modifications (may help mild symptoms or while awaiting treatment):",
      "  - Eat small, frequent meals.",
      "  - Chew food thoroughly and eat slowly.",
